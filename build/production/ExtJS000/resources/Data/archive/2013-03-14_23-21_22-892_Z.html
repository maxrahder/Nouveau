<div type="expander" caption="Improved Performance">
<ul>
<li>In Ext JS 4.1, grid rows were rendered and discarded, one page at a time</li>
<li>In Ext JS 4.2 grids incrementally render rows during scrolling</li>
<li>The result is less latency and more fluid scrolling</li>

<div type="expander" caption="Buffered Grids">
<ul>
<li>In Ext JS 4.0 Sencha introduced "infinite scroll" grids, with somewhat complicated syntax involving
pre-fetching data, buffering and code to specify the grid's scroll-bars.</li>
<li>In Ext JS 4.1 that was refactored, with data stores encapsulating buffering via <code>buffered: true</code></li>
<li>In Ext JS 4.2 grid buffering is done via the <code>Ext.grid.plugin.BufferedRenderer</code> which decouples
the grid from its backing store.</li>
</ul>
</div>
