Models are <em>defined</em>. You rarely write code to create model instances &mdash; that's handled
automatically by the proxy as you fetch data from the server. The term "model" gets ambiguous. Is it
the class declaration or the instance? Some people use "record" to refer to model instances, and model
for the class declaration.

Stores are sometimes defined, especially in MVC.
