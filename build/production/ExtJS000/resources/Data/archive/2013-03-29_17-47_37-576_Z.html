<p>The first thing you will want to do is to open a file or a group of files in the editor. The easiest way to do that is to drag the file/files on top of the IDE. Multiple files or folders can be opened at one time. So that they will be available for easy access later, Go to <strong>Project &gt; Save Project As</strong> and supply a name. When you later open up Sublime Text, go to the same location and choose the name of the file you had previously created.</p>
