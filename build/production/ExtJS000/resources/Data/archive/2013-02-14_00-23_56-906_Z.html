<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In this lab, you will code the category tree.</p>

<ol>

	<li>Plan what you will be doing
		<p>You need to add the tree of categories to the west panel. Then
			detect when the user selects a category, and apply a filter to the
			businesses store. As the user selects categories, the map, dataview
			and grid will reflect the filtered data.</p>
	</li>

	<li>Create the model
		<p>As you learned in lecture, models used with a tree store are
			overlaid with "Ext.node.NodeInterface" fields. The data feed is
			responsible for arranging the data hierarchically, with child nodes
			under elements named "children" and leaf nodes identified with
			"leaf: true".</p>
		<p>Your model declaration only needs to define additional values
			not defined in "NodeInterface". In our case, those fields are "alias"
			and "text". Here is a snippet from the data feed:</p> <pre>{
    "leaf": true,
    "alias" : "discgolf",
    "text" : "Disc Golf"
}, {
    "children" : [ {
        "leaf": true,
        "alias" : "freediving",
        "text" : "Free Diving"
    }, {
        "leaf": true,
        "alias" : "scuba",
        "text" : "Scuba Diving"
    } ],
    "alias" : "diving",
    "text" : "Diving"
}, {
    "leaf": true,
    "alias" : "fishing",
    "text" : "Fishing"
}</pre>
		<p>Recall that the business feed has a "categories" array &mdash; each business belongs to one or more categories. Your
			code needs to detect a selection in the tree, find the corresponding
			text value, then select businesses whose categories contain the
			selection.</p>
		<p>
			Use Sencha Cmd to define a model with the name "Category" and the
			fields "alias" and "text". Look in <a href="" target="api">the
				API documentation</a> if you need a reminder of how to generate a model.
		</p>
		<p>Use this for the proxy:</p> <pre>proxy: {
    type: 'ajax',
    url: 'data/categories.json'
}
</pre>
	</li>

	<li>Create the Categories store
		<p>
			An
			<code>Ext.data.TreeStore</code>
			is a little different from a regular store because they (typically)
			specify a root.
		</p>
		<p>Create file <tt>store/Categories.js</tt> and use this code to define
			the class:</p> <pre>Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.store.Categories', {
    extend : 'Ext.data.TreeStore',
    model : 'YelpExtplorer.model.Category',
    autoLoad : true,
    root : {
        text : 'All',
        alias : '',
        expanded : true
    }
});
</pre>
		<p>This store is used in the Filter controller, so edit
			<tt>controller/Filter.js</tt> and add "Categories" to the <code>stores</code> array and
			add a <code>models</code> array that specifies "Category".</p>
	</li>


	<li>Add the tree panel
		<p>Now that the model and store are there, you can add the tree
			panel and see the category data.</p>
		<p>Open <tt>view/Filter.js</tt> and change it so it extends
			<code>Ext.tree.Panel</code>. Then edit <tt>view/Viewport.js</tt> and have it pass in
			the name of the store, "Categories".</p>
            
		<p>Save your work and refresh your browser, and you should see the
			list of categories on in the filter panel!</p>
            
	</li>

	<li>Have the list of businesses reflect the category selection
    
		<p>So now you need to detect when the user selects a category,
			then filter those records.</p>
            
		<p>Edit <tt>controller/Filter.js</tt>. We need a few things.</p>
        
		<p>
			First, add a references to the categories tree panel and the detail panel. 
			Name them <code>categories</code> and <code>detail</code>, which means you will be able to reference
			them via <code>this.getCategories()</code> and <code>this.getDetail()</code>.</p>
            
		<p>
			Then add another selector in the
			<code>init()</code>
			method. Select the categories tree panel, and on the "select" event,
			run <code>this.updateCategory</code>.
		</p>

		<p><code>updateCategory()</code> is a method you will code that determines the category
			selection, then applies a filter to the business store. Below are two methods: <code>getCategory</code> is a helper method that returns the currently selected category string.
			<code>updateCategory</code>
			is run as the category is selected in the tree. Initially, the code uses
<code>console.log()</code> statements to show what was selected.
		</p>
		<pre>getCategory: function() {
    var record = this.getCategories().getSelectionModel().getSelection()[0];
    return record ? record.get('text') : 'All';
},
updateCategory: function() {
    var category = this.getCategory();
    if(category === 'All') {
        console.log('All -- clear the filter');
        // Clear the business store filter
    } else {
        console.log('Filter on ' + category);
        // On the business store, filter by a function. The function should get
        // the record's "categories" array and return true if the array contains
        // the value in the local variable "category" (from line 1, above).
    }
    this.getDetail().setRecord(null);
}
</pre>
<p>Once the <code>references</code> and <code>init()</code> logic is there, you should see the console.log statements being run as you select items in the tree. That way, you will
know things are wired up correctly and you're detecting the user's selection. Once that works replace the pseudo-code with
the code that applies the filters.</p>
		<p>
			Read <a href="http://localhost/ext-4.1.1a/docs/index.html#!/api/Ext.data.Store" target="api">the API documentation on <code>Ext.data.Store</code></a>
			to figure out how to clear a filter, and how to filter using a
			function.
		</p>
		<p>Make the code changes, save and refresh. Then select various categories. You should see the map and grid update to reflect the filter!
		Note that filters that match zero businesses show the "emptyText" value on the grid and dataview.
		That is all <i>uber cool</i>.</p>
	</li>
    
    <li>Have the view update when the user changes schools<p>One last thing we need to do is to reflect the category selection even when the school changes.</p>
    <p>To do that, add one more statement to the end of the Filter controller's <code>init()</code> method:</p><pre>this.getBusinessesStore().on('load', this.updateCategory, this);</pre>
</li>
    

<h1>Optional</h1>

<li>Add a record count to the filter panel<p>
It would be nice to know exactly how many businesses match a given category.</p><p>To do that, first add a new "bbar" to the filter panel. Put 
a single "tbtext" item in it, with an initial text value of "&nbsp". Give it the itemId "itemCount".</p>
<p>Then go back and edit "controller/Filter.js" again and add a reference to it, named "itemCountLabel". Here is a helper function
that updates the count. Call this method from the <code>updateCategoryMethod</code> you coded in the previous lab step.</p><pre>updateCount: function() {
    var count = this.getBusinessesStore().getCount();
    var singular = (count === 1);
    var s = 'There ' + (singular ? 'is ' : 'are ') + count + ' matching business' + (singular ? '.' : 'es.');
    this.getItemCountLabel().setText(s);
}</pre><p>Save your work and refresh. You should see the record count at the bottom of the filter panel.</p>
</li>
