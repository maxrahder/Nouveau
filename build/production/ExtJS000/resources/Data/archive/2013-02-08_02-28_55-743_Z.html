<p>The primary UAT stages of software development include the alpha and beta testing stages. </p>

<p>In the alpha testing stage, a limited number of users within (and possibly outside) a company test an early version of software for bugs and user interface issues. </p>

<p>In the beta testing stage, a larger group of users (usually outside the company) test the software and provide feedback, including bug reports and usability issues. </p>

<p>This feedback lets the software company know if the product is meeting user expectations and enables the development team to make the necessary revisions before the official release.</p>
