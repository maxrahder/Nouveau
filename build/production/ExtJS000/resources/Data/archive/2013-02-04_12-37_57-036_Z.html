<p>Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle.<p>

<p>First, the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function</p>
<p>Then, produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test</p>
<p>Finally, refactors the new code to acceptable standards</p>
