<p>
When you want to create your own implementation of a theme, you can override variables and mixins used by the theme you are extending from.
These variables and mixins can be found in the following folders:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Theme variables are found in <kbd>.../packages/[theme-you-extend-from]/sass/var</kbd></li>
<li>Theme mixins are found in <kbd>.../packages/[theme-you-extend-from]/sass/etc/mixins/</kbd></li>
<li>Most variables are defined in <kbd>.../packages/ext-theme-neutral/sass/var</kbd></li>
</ul>

<p>
When you want to override them, you can copy the .scss file and folder over to your own theme folder:
<kbd>../packages/[my-custom-theme]/sass/var</kbd> <br/> <kbd>../packages/[my-custom-theme]/sass/etc</kbd>
