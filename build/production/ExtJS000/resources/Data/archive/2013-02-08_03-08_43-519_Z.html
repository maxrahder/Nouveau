<p> In this area BDD chooses to use a semi-formal format for behavioral specification which is borrowed from user story specifications from the field of object-oriented analysis and design. </p>

<div type="expander" caption="Title">
<p> The story should have a clear, explicit title.</p>
</div>
<div type="expander" caption="Narrative">
<p>
    A short, introductory section that specifies<br>
<ul>
       <li> who (which business or project role) is the driver or primary stakeholder of the story (the actor who derives business benefit from the story)</li>
       <li>  which effect the stakeholder wants the story to have</li>
       <li>  what business value the stakeholder will derive from this effect</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<p>
<div type="expander" caption="Acceptance criteria or scenarios">
    a description of each specific case of the narrative. Such a scenario has the following structure:
<ul>
       <li>  It starts by specifying the initial condition that is assumed to be true at the beginning of the scenario. This may consist of a single clause, or several.</li>
       <li>  It then states which event triggers the start of the scenario.</li>
       <li>  Finally, it states the expected outcome, in one or more clauses.</li>

</ul>
