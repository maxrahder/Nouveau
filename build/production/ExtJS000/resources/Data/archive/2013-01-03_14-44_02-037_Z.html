<p>Sencha Cmd is a nice tool on the command line for scaffolding, minifying and deploying your application to production.<p>
<p>
It can generate:
</p>
<ul>
<li>applications</li>
<li>themes</li>
<li>models</li>
<li>forms</li>
<li>controllers</li>
<li>packages</li>
</ul>

<p>Although it's handy to generate code with Sencha Cmd, it's not required.</p>
<p class="small">However, if you are planning to create deployment packages with it, you should use Sencha Cmd from the beginning.</p>
