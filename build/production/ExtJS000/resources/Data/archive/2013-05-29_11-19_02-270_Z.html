<h4>
The next step is to build the theme </h4>
<p>This is done with the following command:</p>
<pre>sencha theme build MyTheme</pre>
<p>
This command will do multiple things; like generating the CSS file from the Sass source,
and also it will slice all the images in the CSS folder. This approach reduces the size of the CSS file since all image paths are relative to the CSS file location.
