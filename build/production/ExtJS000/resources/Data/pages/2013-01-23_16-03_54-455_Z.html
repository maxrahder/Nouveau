<p>
Selection models fire a <b>select</b> and <b>selectionchange</b> events 
(and some others). As a convenience, these events are also fired 
by the grid, so normally you listen to the grid event rather 
than listen to the selection model directly.
</p>
<p>
The "select" event handler has the signature 
<br/><code>select(selectionModel, record)</code>
<br/>This event lets you know what just got selected.
</p>
<p>
The "selectionchange" event handler has the signature 
<br/><code>selectionchange(selectionModel, record[])</code>
<br/>This event lets you know everything currently selected.
