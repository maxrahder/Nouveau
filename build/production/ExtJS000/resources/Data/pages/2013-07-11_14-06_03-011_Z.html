There's 
<a href="http://localhost/SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/LabSolutions/MVC/SheLovesMeWithLogging/" target="lab">another version</a> of the example application that logs to the console
as classes are loaded and created.
</p>
  
<p>
Every class mentioned in a <code>models</code>, <code>stores</code>, <code>views</code> and
<code>controllers</code> arrays are loaded automatically. 
</p>
<p>
The controllers and stores are both loaded <i>and created</i>.
