<p>When a developer creates a form, the developer is the one doing the thinking. It is up to you to anticipate incorrect completion of a form and to do anything possible to assure that the end-user knows what you want from them.
</p>

<p>By customizing error messages, you can inform the end-user of what is wrong and the data returned is more likely to be more accurate.</p>

<div type="expander" caption="blankText">
<p>The error text to display if the allowBlank validation fails (defaults to 'This field is required')</p>
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="minLengthText/maxLengthText">
<p>Error text to display if the minimum length or maximum length validation fails (defaults to 'The minimum (or maximum) length for this field is {minLength} or {maxLength}')</p>
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="regexText" >
<p>The error text to display if regex is used and the test fails during validation (Message defaults to the empty string)</p>
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="vtypeText" >
<p>A custom error message to display in place of the default message provided for the vtype currently set for this field (Message defaults to undefined).</p>

<p><small><b>Note: </b><i> Only applies if vtype is set, otherwise it is ignored.</i></small></p>
</div>
