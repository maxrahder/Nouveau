<h1>Sencha Cmd</h1>
<p>
You will need to have Sencha Cmd 3.1 (or higher) installed.
</p>

<p>
Sencha Cmd 3.1 removes the need to have Sass and Compass installed on your computer since it uses its own bundled version of Sass and Compass.
</p>

<h1>Ruby</h1>
<p>
To build themes using Sass on Windows, download and install Ruby. 
Ruby is already provided by Mac OS X.</p>
<p>Be sure that you have either ruby 1.8.7 or 1.9.3 with <code>ruby -v</code></p>
<p><b>Ruby 2.x will not work!</b></p>
See appendix: <b>Appendix > Setup and Organization > Install Ruby</b>
</p>
