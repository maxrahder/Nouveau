<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
You've been hired by the your country's oceanographic institute to develop an application that tracks 
the world's consumption of seafood. 
</p>

<p>
Write an application that shows a table of country names and consumption, along with a graph of the same information. You'll be using 
<a href="http://localhost/SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/Labs/Charts/data/fishConsumption.json" target="_blank">this test dataset</a> of countries and per capita consumption (kg).

<br/>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<ol>

<li>With the whole class, discuss what you need</code>
<p>
The instructor will lead a discussion of the application, and the chart in particular. What does
the data look like? What axes and series will be needed?
</p>
</li>

<li>Run the stubbed out application<p>Visit the starting application. The grid works, but the chart in the center is stubbed out.</p></li>

<li>Inspect the code</code>
<p>Using an editor, go to the student folder and inspect the <kbd>Charts/</kbd> directory. You'll find
a MVC application that's partially complete. The store, model and grid are complete. The chart
is stubbed out.</p>

<p>Briefly review all source files in the application. If called upon, could you explain the order of execution and what each class does?</p>
<p>In particular, look at the <kbd>app.js</kbd>: it uses <code>launch</code> to create the viewport, passing in the name of the store to both
the grid and the chart.</p>

</li>

<li>Have the <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/#!/api/Ext.chart.Chart" target="api">API documentation</a> ready
<p>Charts have a lot of properties, so fire up the API documentation. When in doubt, look it up.</p>
</li>

<li>Plan how to code the chart

<p>
As discussed at the beginning of the lab, we're plotting a line chart with the countries names
as the independent variable on the x-axis and consumption as the dependent variable on the y-axis.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, you need to define two axes in the chart's series <code>axes</code> array, and one line series in the 
chart's <code>series</code> array.
</p>
</li>

<li>Start editing the chart<p></p></li>
<p>Open <kbd>view/Chart.js</kbd> and remove the <code>html</code> property in the chart. That was just 
there so we could see that the component was rendering.
</p>
</li>  

<li>Code the axes
<p>
The chart needs a <b>numeric</b> axis on the left, and a <b>categorical</b> axis on the bottom. Use the fields 
from the store to establish the range of values on each axis. Set the title for each axis. 
</p>
<p>
Note that the code will run even without a <code>series</code> array. So just code the axes and verify that
it runs before moving on. You should see a numeric range from 0 to 100 on the left, and country names on 
the bottom. Both axes should have a title.
</p>
</li>

<li>Rotate the country names
<p>
By default, the country names don't show up very well. Therefore, rotate the labels 45&deg;. 
</p>
<pre>
label : {
    rotate : {
        degrees : 45
    }
}
</pre>

</li>

<li>Code the series
<p>
We could use a line, column or scatter series to show the data. We'll use a line.
</p>
<p>
Add a single series to the chart, of type line, plotting country and consumption.</p>
<p>
You need to specify the series type, and x- and y-axis fields. In theory you also specify
the axis the series is plotted against, but since that defaults to left and bottom, you can omit
that config. Also set <code>highlight:true</code> &mdash; that will make the marker highlight as you
mouse over it.
</p>
</li>

<li>How does it look?
<p>
You should be seeing the grid and the chart! Try sorting the grid columns. The chart reflects
the sort. 
</p>
<p>
Do you see any trends in the data? It looks like Icelanders eat a lot more fish than Tajiks!</p>
</li>

<li>New requirement: Sync the grid with the chart
<p>
Your users want to see the corresponding data point highlighted as they mouse over the grid.
</p>
<p>
That means we'll need an event handler on the grid, and a way of having the chart highlight
the corresponding data point. This will be a little tricky.
</p>
</li>

<li>Add a "highlight record" method to the chart
<p>
Charts don't have a direct way of highlighting a record's data point, so we need a new function
for that. We asked a colleague down the hall to code that up, and here's what she gave us:
</p>
<pre>
highlightItem : function(record) {
    // Highlight the item referencing the record
    var series = this.series.get(0); // The line is the first item
    series.unHighlightItem(); // Un-highlight everything
    if (!record){
        return;
    }
    var items = series.items;
    for ( var i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
        if (items[i].storeItem === record) {
            series.highlightItem(items[i]);
            break;
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
Copy and paste this new method into the chart class. Save your change, then refresh your browser (to make sure 
nothing is broken).
</p>

<li>Listen and react to the user mousing over grid items
<p>
Since we're coordinating events, stores and components, this logic goes in our controller, which is
in <kbd>controller/Grid.js</kbd>.
</p>

<p>In the controller's <code>init()</code> method, add a call to <code>this.control()</code>, specifying the component we're 
selecting, an event, and a function handling the event. If you'd like, look at
 <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/#!/api/Ext.app.Controller" target="api">the API documentation</a> to see 
how the <code>init()</code> and <code>control()</code> functions work together.
</p>

<p>
In the call to <code>this.control()</code> you'll select the grid using its <code>xtype</code> &mdash; <em>consumptiongrid</em>. 
Listen to the <code>itemmouseenter</code> event. Have it run <code>this.itemSelectHandler</code>.
</p>

<p>
Here's the code for <b>itemSelectHandler</b>. Copy and paste it into the controller. For now, it's just logging 
that the method is being run. In a minute we'll add code to highlight the item on the chart.
</p>
<pre>
itemSelectHandler : function(component, record) {
    console.log(this.$className + '#itemSelectHandler');
}</pre>
</li>

<p>Save your work, and refresh your browser. At this point, when you mouse over the grid, you should see the <code>itemSelectHandler</code> 
log statements being run. 
</p>

</li>

<li>Add logic to highlight the item on the chart

<p>Modify <b>itemSelectHandler</b> to run the <code>highlightItem</code> method we added previously.</p>

<p>Because of the <code>refs</code> array, the controller provides a handy way to get a reference to the chart. 
So in <code>itemSelectHandler</code> all you need to do is run <code>highlightItem</code> on the chart, passing the record:
</p>
<pre>
itemSelectHandler : function(component, record) {
    this.getChart().highlightItem(record);
}
</pre>
</li>

<li>Make the grid selection prominent
<p>
Your code should work, but the default marker highlighting is pretty subtle. Let's make it
more noticeable.
</p>
<p>
Currently, our chart logic in <kbd>view/Chart.js</kbd> just sets <code>highlight: true</code> in the series.
</p>

<p>Change that to be a config object, specifying that the highlighted item be a blue-filled circle, 
radius 10. As you recall from lecture, highlighting is done via a sprite, so please read the sprite
<a href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/#!/api/Ext.draw.Sprite" target="api">API documentation</a>
for details. 
</p>

</li>

<li>How does it look?
<p>You should see your new larger circle as you mouse over the series, and as you mouse over the
chart! Pretty cool. 
</li>

<li>One last change
<p>
Your pesky users have one more request. As the mouse leaves the grid, they want there to be no
highlighted item on the chart. 
</p>
<p>
In <kbd>controller/Grid.js</kbd>, detect the grid's <code>itemmouseleave</code> event. Name the listener 
<kbd>itemNoSelectHandler</kbd>. It has the same function signature as the item select handler. The new
listener will have one line, which is a call to the chart's <code>highlightItem</code> function, passing
no parameters. (The <code>highlightItem</code> method is coded to first un-highlight everything, then 
return if there was no record.)
</p>
<p>
Code it, then try it. As you mouse over the grid, the highlight should appear. As you mouse out
of the grid the previously highlighted item should be un-highlighted.
</p>

<h1>Optional</h1>

<li>New requirement: Mousing over chart items should be reflected in the grid
</li>
<p>
Since mousing over the grid highlights the chart, your users have reasoned that mousing
over the chart should highlight the grid. 
</p>
<p>
Series do throw events, but since a series isn't a component, it can't be directly
selected in a controller. 
</p>
<p>
One way to handle this is to have the chart detect and re-fire the event. In this way, the 
controller can listen to the chart component without needing to know about the internal details
of how the event was originally fired.
</p>

<li>Have the chart fire a <code>itemmouseover</code> event
<p>
A series fires <code>itemmouseover</code> when the user mouses over an item. So what we'll do is
to use the series config to add a listener to that event, and in the handler, have the
parent chart throw an event of the same name.
</p>
<p>
Edit <kbd>view/Chart.js</kbd>. In the series config, add a <code>listeners</code> config. There are a 
few ways of configuring a listener. In this case, we'll specify the event and associated anonymous 
function. The event is passed the series item, which has a reference to the parent series, which in 
turn has a reference to the chart. Once we have that reference, we can have the chart component fire 
the new event.
</p>
<p>Here's the entire series array after making that change:</p>
<pre>
    series : [ {
        type : 'line',
        xField : 'country',
        yField : 'consumption',
        axis : [ 'left', 'bottom' ],
        highlight : {
            type : 'circle',
            radius : 10,
            fill : 'blue',
        },
        listeners : {
            itemmouseover : function(item) {
                var chart = item.series.chart;
                chart.fireEvent('itemmouseover', chart, item.storeItem);
            }
        }
    } ],
</pre>
<p>
Take a careful look at the call to <code>fireEvent</code>. The first argument is the name of the event.
You can use any string you want, as long as we use the same name in our controller. The other
parameters are passed to the event handler. By convention, events usually pass the component
that fired the event, plus any other pertinent data. Therefore, we're passing the chart, since
it's firing the event, along with the record.
</p>
</li>

<li>Have the controller listen to the new event
<p>
Use your editor and open <kbd>controller/Grid.js</kbd> and add in the <code>init</code> method select the chart
and listen to the new event. Notice that the event signature is the same as <code>itemSelectHandler</code>,
so simply use that event handler.
</p>

<p>
Modify the <code>itemSelectHandler</code> function to do one additional thing: select the item on the grid. 
This is done via a grid's "selection model." Look in 
<a href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/#!/api/Ext.grid.Panel" target="api">the API documentation</a> for the getter method 
used to get a grid's selection model. Then figure out the select model method used to select a record. It's one line 
of code.
</p>

</li>

</ol>

<p><b>That's it!</b><br/>
Mouse over the grid, and see the markers change. Mouse over the markers, and see the grid selection change. Your users will be very happy. <kbd>:-)</kbd>
