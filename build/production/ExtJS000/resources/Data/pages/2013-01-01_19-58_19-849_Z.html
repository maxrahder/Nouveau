All you need to write Ext JS code is a text editor. But there are ways to 
make coding more productive:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Use third-party add-ons that perform JavaScript formatting and syntax checking</li>
<li>Sencha has an Eclipse plugin for code completion</li>
<li>Use Sencha Cmd, command-line tools for code generation</li>
<li>Use Sencha Architect, a drag-and-drop visual application builder</li>
</ul>
