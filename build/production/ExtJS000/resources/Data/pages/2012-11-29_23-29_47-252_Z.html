<p>
The <code>Ext.menu.Menu</code> has some features only available if you use a full config
object as the button's <code>menu</code> property (versus simply passing the array of buttons).
<code>Ext.menu.Menu</code> is a panel subclass, which means its items can be any type of 
component.

<p>
In addition, there is a <code>Ext.container.ButtonGroup</code> container that can arrange 
buttons in a tabular manner.
