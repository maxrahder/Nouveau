<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This lab lets you experiment with border layout.</p>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<ol>

	<li>Inspect <kbd>Labs/Layouts/Border/app.js</kbd>
		<p>
			Use your IDE to inspect
			<kbd>Labs/Layouts/Border/app.js</kbd>
			. The code creates a window. Run the application using your browser. You should see a rectangular window, with the
			title "Border".
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>Specify the window's layout and add two children
		<p>
			Add a
			<code>layout: 'border'</code>
			property, and an
			<code>items</code>
			array. In the items array, specify two children using this code:
		</p> <pre>
items : [{
    title : 'West'
}, {
    title : 'Center'
}]</pre>
		<p>
			Save your changes and refresh your browser. It should <em>not</em> look very good. Why? Because we haven't specified
			the position of the regions.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>Add <code>region</code> properties
		<p>
			To the child panel titled "West" add a
			<code>region: 'west'</code>
			property. Specify
			<code>region: 'center'</code>
			to the other panel.
		</p>
		<p>Save and refresh. Now the center panel takes up all the space. We still aren't seeing the west panel.
	<li>Specify the heights and widths of the panels
		<p>We aren't seeing the west panel because it needs to specify its width (or its children do).</p>
		<p>Add a <code>width</code> of 80 to the west panel, save and refresh. You should see the west panel.</p>
		<p>Try specifying a <code>height</code> of 10 to the west panel. And specify a <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> of 10 to the center panel. Save
			and refresh.</p>
		<p>Those settings are ignored. A panel on the sides takes up all the available height, so the height property is
			ignored. Panels on the top or bottom take up all the available width, so setting width on those panels is ignored.
			The center panel takes up all the remaining space, so both its height and width are ignored.</p>
	</li>

	<li>Add other panels
		<p>Add north, east and south panels. Set their heights or widths, where relevant.</p>
		<p>Save and refresh. Are you seeing all panels: north, east, south, west and center? Do they have the heights and
			widths you expect? If not, ask the instructor to help you figure out why.</p>
	</li>

	<li>Set the north panel's relative weight
		<p>By default, the north panel's weight makes it take up the entire width of the parent: the west and east panels
			are under it.</p>
		<p>Modify this priority by setting both the east and west panel <code>weight</code> to 20, and the north panel <code>weight</code> to 10.</p>
		<p>Save and refresh. Since the west and east panels have a greater weight than the north panel, they should both
			now extend to the top of the parent panel. The north panel should be between them.</p>
	</li>


	<li>Make the panels collapsible
		<p>
			Make the border panels collapsible via
			<code>collapsible:true</code>
			.
		</p>
		<p>This setting only affects the west, north, east and south panels. With border layout the center panel is always
			seen; it doesn't make sense to specify collapsible for the center panel.</p>
		<p>Save and refresh. Is each panel collapsible?</p>
		<p>
			Add
			<code>collapseMode:'mini'</code>
			to the west panel. Save and refresh: the west panel should now fully collapse, hiding its title.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>Use flex for the east panel
		<p>
			Replace the east panel's width with
			<code>flex:0.5</code>
		</p>
		<p>Panels specifying widths and heights have a fixed value. Specifying flex makes the value proportional. By
			default, the center panel is flex 1. So setting the east panel to 0.5 means it will take up half the width of the
			center panel.</p>
		<p>Save and refresh. Is the east panel half the width of the center panel? Resize the window &mdash; are the
			center and east panels maintaining their relative widths?</p>
	</li>
	
	
	<h1>Optional</h1>

    <li>Change weights to make west more important than east
        <p>
            Change the panels' weights so that the west panel takes up the full height of the parent window and
            the north and south should take up all the remaining widths. The east takes should up the remaining 
            space between the north and south panels.
        </p>
    </li>
