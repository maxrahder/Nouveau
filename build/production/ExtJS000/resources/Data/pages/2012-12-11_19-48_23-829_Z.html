<p>
If you have a constructor, you're free to have it do whatever you want, but two statements are important.
</p>

<div type="expander" caption="<code>this.initConfig(config)</code>">
<p>
This applies the calling routine's passed config properties. In theory, you only need
to do this once, in your base class.
</p>
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="<code>this.callParent(arguments)</code>">
<p>
This calls the ancestor method for whatever method you're in. If you're in the constructor,
it will call the parent's constructor. 
</p>
<p><code>arguments</code> is a reserved word in JavaScript. It's an array of all the parameters
passed in by the calling routine. By stating <code>this.callParent(arguments);</code> we're 
just saying "call the ancestor method, passing whatever was passed to me."
</div>
