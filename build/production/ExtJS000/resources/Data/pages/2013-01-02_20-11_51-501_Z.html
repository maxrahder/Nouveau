<p>
You have two choices when viewing documentation: viewing the documentation
on the Sencha site, or viewing the documentation included with your local
install. 
</p>

<div type="expander" caption="Documentation on docs.sencha.com" >
<p>
Documentation on the Sencha site will be for the current and previous releases. 
The documentation also includes comments from the user community. </p>
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="Your local copy" >
<p>
The documentation for your installation will be for the version you're 
running. Sometimes it's better to see the API for your code, than the API 
for the current release, since there may be syntax differences.
