<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Let's start with creating your first full working MVC application. Does this sound scary?
You don't need to be. Since you will generate this application it requires less coding skills.
This lab requires that the latest version of <a href="?page=Appendix%20>%20Setup%20and%20Organization%20>%20Sencha%20Cmd">Sencha Cmd</a> is correctly installed.
</p>
<p>
You will create the <strong>MyDemoApp</strong> in the <strong>XAMPP/htdocs/Student/labs folder</strong>.
</p>

<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
<li>Verify that Sencha Cmd is correctly installed and added to the class path.
<p>Open your console/terminal and enter the command: <code>sencha which</code>.
It should prompt you the Sencha Cmd version number. If the version number < 3.0.2, reinstall Sencha Cmd,
please follow the <a href="?page=Appendix%20>%20Setup%20and%20Organization%20>%20Sencha%20Cmd">install guide</a>.
If you are having problems, please ask your instructor to help you.</p>
</li>
<li>Prepare the folder structure
<p>In the <b>htdocs/Student</b> folder, create a folder called: <strong>labs</strong> (htdocs/Student/labs).</p>
<p>In the <b>htdocs</b> folder, make sure there is a copy of Ext JS in a folder named: <strong>extjs4</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>Navigate with your console/terminal navigate to the extjs4 folder.
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Generate your app by entering the following command:
<pre>
sencha generate app MyDemoApp ../Student/labs/MyDemoApp
</pre>
<p>(You can almost generate everything with Sencha Cmd; type in your console: <code>sencha help generate</code> to see an overview of what else you can generate.)</p>
</li>
<li>
Open the <strong>MyDemoApp</strong> <a href="http://localhost/Student/labs/MyDemoApp/" target="labs">http://localhost/Student/labs/MyDemoApp/</a>
in your browser.
<p>You should see your MyDemoApp application, with 2 columns. The center column contains a tabpanel.</p>
</li>
<li>
Review the generated folder structure of the MyDemoApp in Finder/File Explorer.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Keep the files on your localhost. You will use it later for the Eclipse Lab.</p>
