Files must be named after Ext JS package/class names <i>or</i> your own <code>view</code>
package. Only matching files are processed.

<p>
For example, button CSS variables would be assigned in <kbd>sass/var/button/Button.scss</kbd>. 
You can also create <kbd>.scss</kbd> files corresponding to classes in your <code>view</code> package.
