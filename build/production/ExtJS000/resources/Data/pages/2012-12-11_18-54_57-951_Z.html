<p>
The example on the previous slide is a little poor, because we just called the class "Mammal". 
</p>
<p>
Like most OO languages, you normally use packages. Packages 
group related classes. In addition, Ext JS has the concept of a "namespace" &mdash;
or application name &mdash; which is the root value under-which all your packages are placed. 
</p>
<p>
You should <em>always</em> use an application name and packages.

<pre class="runnable">
Ext.define('MyApp.taxonomy.Mammal', {});
var m = Ext.create('MyApp.taxonomy.Mammal');
alert('Instance of ' + m.$className + ' which extends ' + m.superclass.$className);</pre>
