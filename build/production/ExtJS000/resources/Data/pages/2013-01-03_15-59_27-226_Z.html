<p>
The Beatles application implements <b>requires</b> in a couple of places: 
</p>
<p>
The viewport has one, because it references the grid by xtype, and the xtype
declaration is in <code>BeatlesGrid</code>.
</p>
<p>
And <code>BeatlesGrid</code> has one because one of the grid columns uses an
xtype defined in <code>Ext.grid.column.Date</code>.
