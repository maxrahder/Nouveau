<p>
Layouts are always specified via the layout alias &mdash; you never use <code>Ext.create()</code>
to create the layout. 
</p>
<p>
You can either specify the alias alone, which results in the layout's default constructor 
being run, or you pass a config to be passed to the constructor.
</p>
<p>
Typically you use the defaults, but read the API documentation for a given layout to see what features
are available.
