<h1>Steps</h1>

<ol>

    <li>Plan what you will be doing
        <p>Under the "View" tab you need a dataview, wired up to the
            Businesses store. You will be adding a few properties that
            specify CSS classes to use as the user mouses over or
            selects items.</p>
        <p>Then you will update the Business controller to detect a
            select on the view. The event handler will sync the user
            interface with the selected record.</p>
    </li>

<li>Modify <kbd>view/View.js</kbd> to show businesses data
    
<p>Have the yepview extend <code>Ext.view.View</code>. 

<p>
Add an initial item template and a few other properties to verify that we've wired up the viewport correctly:
</p> 

<pre>autoScroll: true,
emptyText: 'There are no matching businesses.',
padding: 8,
itemTpl: '{name}'
</pre>

<p>Since we have just created our content, remove the <code>html</code> property.</p>

</li>


<li>Associate the store with the view
        <p>
            Edit <kbd>view/Main.js</kbd> and add
            <code>store:'Businesses'</code>
            to the dataview config.
        </p>
        
        <p>Save and refresh and you should see the dataview
            showing the name of each business. 
</li>



<li>Add a style sheet
        <p>
<p>
Create a new file, <b>stylesheet.css</b> and
place it at the root of the YelpExtplorer folder at the
same level as the <kbd>index.html</kbd>. Here is the content of the
CSS file:
</p> 
<pre>.yepview-business {
    height: 134px;
    width: 108px;
    margin: 4px;
    float: left;
    border: 4px solid #dddddd;
}
.yepview-business img {
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
}
.yepview-business figure {
    margin: 0px;
}
.yepview-business figcaption {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 7pt;
}
.yepview-business.over  {
    border: 4px solid #999999;
    background-color: #F5F6CE;
}
.yepview-business.selected {
    border: 4px solid black;
    background-color: yellow;
}
</pre>
        <p>Save the CSS file, then open <kbd>index.html</kbd> and add a link
            to the new style sheet. 
</p>
</li>


<li>Modify <kbd>view/View.js</kbd> to make full use of the stylesheet

<p>
The stylesheet defines styles to be applied to each business and styles applied
when mousing over and selecting a business. We'll specify those CSS classes in 
viewport configs.
</p>
<p>
The <code>itemCls</code> style is applied to each item. The mouse over and selected styles are specified with <code>overItemCls</code> and <code>selectedItemCls</code>. 
</p>
    
<p>Replace the <code>itemTpl</code> and add <code>itemCls</code>, <code>overItemCls</code> and <code>selectedItemCls</code>:
</p> 

<pre>itemTpl: '&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="{photo_url}" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;{name}&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;',
itemCls: 'yepview-business',
overItemCls: 'over',
selectedItemCls: 'selected'</pre>

<p>
Save and refresh the browser. You should see the business name and image. You should
see the <code>itemCls</code> style in effect for each business. Mouse over an item and 
the <code>overItemCls</code> style should be applied. Select an item and the <code>selectedItemCls</code> style should be applied.</p>

</li>


<li>
Show business details when an item is selected in the dataview
        <p>
            Edit the <code>init</code> method in 
            <kbd>controller/Business.js</kbd>
            and listen to the <code>select</code> event on the dataview. This will
            be virtually identical to the code that listens to the map.
        </p>
        
</li>
    


    <li>Keep the map and dataview selections in sync
        <p>
            Add two new items to the <code>refs</code> array: one for the dataview, and one for the map.
            Name them "dataView" and "map". This will allow us to access
            these components in our controller methods with
            <code>this.getDataView()</code>
            and
            <code>this.getMap()</code>
            .
        </p>
        <p>
            In the
            <code>onBusinessSelect</code>
            method, add two new lines to select the record on the
            dataview and in the map. The idea is that when someone
            clicks on either the map or the dataview item, all parts of
            the user interface will reflect the selection. The two new
            lines look like this:
        </p> <pre>this.getDataView().getSelectionModel().select(record);
this.getMap().highlight(record);</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Wait! There's something wrong!<p>You may have noticed that if you select a school, 
    then select the dataview, then select a map item. Then things are in sync properly.
    You can then select another item on the map, and the dataview stays in sync.</p>

    <p>But if you initially select an item on the map, then go to the dataview, you don't
    see the item selected. This only happens the first time! What's going on?</p>
    
    <p>Recall from our discussion that components do not render until they need to. In this case,
    the dataview doesn't render the template until the user clicks on the View tab. But the way
    items are shown to be selected in a dataview is via a class being added to a DOM element
    defined in the dataview's template. Before the dataview is rendered there <i>is no</i> DOM 
    element. If you were to inspect the DOM you'd see this in action: the dataview elements don't 
    exist in the DOM until you click on the View tab.</p>
    <p>
    To fix this, open <kbd>view/Main.js</kbd> and add one more property to the tab panel: <code>deferredRender:false</code></p>
    <p>Save your change, and refresh the browser. Immediately select a map item, then go to the View tab. The item 
    should be selected!</p></li>
