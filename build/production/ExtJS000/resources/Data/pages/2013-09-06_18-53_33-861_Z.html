<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
In this lab you will have your application use the Neptune theme.
</br>

<h1>Objectives</h1>
<ul class="plain">
<li>Change the application theme</li>
</ul>

<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>

<li>
  <p>
    Review how the application references its style sheet
  <p>
    Open <kbd>YelpExtplorer/index.html</kbd> and note that it references <kbd>bootstrap.css</kbd>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Open <kbd>YelpExtplorer/bootstrap.css</kbd> and note that by default, it references the classic theme
    package in your workspace's <kbd>ext/packages</kbd> folder.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
    Change your application's theme to Neptune
  <p>
    Open <kbd>app.json</code> and add this property:</p>
<pre>"theme": "ext-theme-neptune"</pre>
</p>
<p>
In your terminal window, navigate to your application root folder and build your application via:
</p>
<pre>sencha app build testing</pre>
<p>
This will create a new, non-minimized CSS file based on the specified theme, along with any application-specific theming. We don't have any application-specific theming yet &mdash; we'll add that in the next lab.

</p>
<p>
Open <kbd>YelpExtplorer/bootstrap.css</kbd> again and note that it now points to the newly generated theme.
</p>

<li>Refresh your application
<p>
In your web browser visit or refresh YelpExtplorer. You should see the Neptune theme.
</p>
