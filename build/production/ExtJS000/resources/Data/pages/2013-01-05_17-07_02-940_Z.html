<p>
Normally, ".js" files are cached by your browser. 
</p>
<p>
But the loader intentionally disables caching by by appending
a "_dc" (don't cache) parameter to each HTTP call it uses to load files.
This defeats whatever caching policy your server might have, and therefore 
guarantees that you get a fresh copy of all components.
</p>
<p>This can be disabled using the <code>Ext.Loader</code>:</p>
<pre>
Ext.Loader.setConfig({
    enabled: true,
    disableCaching : false // Do not disable caching
});
</pre>
