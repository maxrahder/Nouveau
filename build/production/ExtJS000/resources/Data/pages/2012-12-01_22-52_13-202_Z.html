<p>
This is a subtle point, but any component's DOM doesn't get rendered until it needs to be rendered. 
This cuts down on overhead and makes things more efficient.
</p>
<p>Here, there is a button on the second tab, but it's not until the user actually
<em>selects</em> the second tab that it needs to be seen, and therefore, it gets rendered.
</p>
<p>
You may rarely write code that needs to do something to rendered content on a tab
that hasn't been shown. And that's what <code>deferredRender</code> controls. Setting it to 
false makes the DOM render immediately.

<pre class="runnable preview">
Ext.create('Ext.tab.Panel', {
    renderTo : Ext.getBody(),
    height : 200,
    width : 200,

    deferredRender : true, // true is the default

    defaults : {
        layout : 'vbox',
        bodyPadding : 8

            handler : function(b){ 

                var component = Ext.getCmp('buttontwo');
                alert('The other button ' + (component?'exists.':'does not exist.'));
                // It exists, so we can run any method we want on it...
                component.setText('This is the new button text');

                var element = Ext.fly('buttontwo');
                alert('The other button\'s DOM ' + (element?'DOES exist.':'does NOT exist.'));
