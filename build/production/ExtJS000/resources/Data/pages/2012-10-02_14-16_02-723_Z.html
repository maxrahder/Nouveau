<p>There are two philosophies when it comes to creating objects: 
<em>procedural</em> and <em>declarative</em></p>

<div type="expander" caption="Procedural" class="x-hidden">The procedural approach starts 
with creating the object, then running various setters on it to set the object's state.</div>

<div type="expander" caption="Declarative" class="x-hidden">In the declarative approach you 
<em>describe</em> the object as you create it.
