In theory, you could use an AJAX call to load and <code>eval</code> the corresponding locale file.
</p>
<pre>
Ext.Ajax.request({
    url: '/extjs4/locale/ext-lang-' + locale + '.js',
    success: function (response) {
        eval(response.responseText);
  }
});
</pre>
<p>
However, locale values are used when components are <i>created</i> &mdash; there's no way to 
refresh them after-the-fact. Therefore, with this technique you'd need to destroy and
recreate your user interface for the change in locale to be reflected.
