<p>
The files in <kbd>sass/var</kbd> and <kbd>sass/src</kbd> <u>must</u> be named after your application's package/class names. Only matching files are processed.
</p>
<p>For example, if your application has a file named <kbd>app/view/Viewport.js</kbd>,
you can create a file named <kbd>sass/var/Viewport.scss</kbd> &mdash; it will be automatically
processed when you build your application.
</p>
<p>
Place Sass code in the file that most closely relates to the 
corresponding affected component. Global variables and Sass 
source can be placed in <kbd>Application.sass</kbd> or 
<kbd>Viewport.sass</kbd>.
