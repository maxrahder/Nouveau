<p>You can only use <kbd>sencha app build</kbd> on an application originally created using Cmd. To convert an application you hand-coded into an application you can build:</p>
<ul class="plain">
<li>Use Cmd to create a new workspace</li>
<li>Use Cmd to create a new application with the same name as your application</li>
<li>Copy your application's resources to the new application</li>
<li>Copy your application's app/ folder to the new application (and remove the generated code)</li>
<li>Recreate the application's bootstrap files via <kbd>sencha app refresh</kbd></li>
<li>That's it!</li>
</ul>
<p>This procedure only works if your application is property structured according to
Sencha's <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.1/#!/guide/command_code" target="api">Compiler-Friendly Code Guidelines</a>.
