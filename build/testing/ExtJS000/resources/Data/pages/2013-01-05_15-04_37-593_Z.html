As you've seen, Ext JS dynamically loads files as they are referenced &mdash;
if a file is not already in memory, it's loaded.
</p>
<p>This applies to <em>all</em> classes being references, both your own
classes and classes in the Ext JS library. In other words, if you create
a <code>Ext.panel.Panel</code>, and it's not already in memory, its source
file will be dynamically loaded.

<p><b>Question:</b> But won't the library classes already be in memory?
<br/>
<p><b>Answer:</b> It depends on what library you're using.
