<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This lab will let you do some problem solving with <code>Ext.Array</code> methods.</p>
<p>As with all labs, 
<b>take your time, read each step carefully and ask questions if things aren't working out</b>. <kbd>:-)</kbd>

The solution of this lab can be found in the <a href="http://localhost/SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/LabSolutions/Array/" target="api">/SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/LabSolutions/Array/</a> folder.
</p>

<p>Consider the data set of student grades, shown below.</p>
<pre class="sample">
var studentScores = [
    {name: 'Beatrix', score: 67}, 
    {name: 'Clive', score: 84}, 
    {name: 'Julia', score: 95}, 
    {name: 'Bruno', score: 42}, 
    {name: 'Hubert', score: 87}
];
</pre>
<p>Your assignment is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show a list of students names, in alphabetical order.</li>
<li>Show a list of students from high score to low.</li>
<li>Optionally: Show the standard deviation of all scores.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of what we'll do could be made easier through good use of feeds, models and convert columns,  
but to get hands-on with array functions will stick to those methods for this lab.</p>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<ol>

<li>Have the API documentation ready
<p>You can review class slides, or you can refer to 
<a href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/#!/api/Ext.Array-method-sort" target="api">the API documentation</a>. But remember, 
efficient programmers don't bother memorizing anything &mdash; efficient programmers have the API documentation at their fingertips.</p>
</li>

<li>Show an alphabetized list of student names
		<p>
Open <code>app.js</code> in your text editor. Add code to create a new array by extracting the list of names from <em>studentScores</em>, and
sort the new array using the default collating order.
		</p>
  
<p>How are you going to do that?</p>
<p class="small">Hint: There is a <code>Ext.Array</code> function that lets you pull a value from each
element of an array. It's as if you were reaching in with your fingers, and <em>plucking</em>
the value from every item. <kbd>;-)</kbd></p>
</li>

<li>Show a list of names, from high score to low.

<p>There's a few ways you could do this. But try it this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sort the original array in score order. You'll need a compare routine for this.</li>
<li>Like you did before, create a new array of the names from the array.</li>
<li>Show the new array using <code>alert()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a couple of ways to implement the compare function. Either as a referenced
function, or as an anonymous function.
</p>
<p>Using a referenced function:</p>
<pre class="sample">
var compareScores = function(o1, o2) {
    // Your code goes here -- return negative, zero or positive value
    // based on the relative value of the scores passed into o1 and o2.
};
Ext.Array.sort(studentScores, compareScores);
</pre>
<p>Using an anonymous function:</p>
<pre class="sample">
Ext.Array.sort(studentScores, function(o1, o2) {
        // Your code goes here -- return negative, zero or positive value
        // based on the relative value of the scores passed into o1 and o2.
    };
);
</pre>
<p>Try it. Are the names shown in order of their scores?</p>

</li>

<li>Display the names and scores together
<p>
Add code at step 4 to display the values in an alert:
</p>
<pre class="sample">
// Use Ext.Array.forEach() to visit every item in the array, and for each item,
// concatenate the person's name and score. Assuming the array item is in a
// variable named "item", the concatenation code looks like:
// s += '\n' + item.name + '=' + item.score;
</pre>
</p>
</li>

<h1>Optional</h1>

Calculate the standard deviation
<p>"Remind me: How is standard deviation calculated?"</p>
<p>
Since you probably haven't calculated a standard deviation in a week or two,
recall that it's the square root of the variance.</p>
<p>
The variance is the average of the squared difference of each item.
</p>
<p>
The squared difference is just the square of the difference between a value 
and the mean.
</p>
<p>We'll build each of these values, piece by piece.</p>

<li>Do you still feel like doing the optional steps?
<p>Of course you do!</p>
</li>

<li>Calculate and show each student's squared difference

<p>First, calculate the average (or <em>mean</em>) of all scores, and save that in a variable. (Maybe 
there's an <code>Ext.Array</code> function that calculates the mean!) To do this, you'll need to do pluck 
off the scores from the studentScores array, and take the mean of the new array.
</p>

<p>
Now that you have the mean of all scores, you can calculate the squared differences. The new squared differences array 
will end up looking like this:
</p>
<pre class="sample">
[
    {name: 'Beatrix', squaredDifference: 64}, 
    {name: 'Clive', squaredDifference: 81}, 
    {name: 'Julia', squaredDifference: 400}, 
    {name: 'Bruno', squaredDifference: 1089}, 
    {name: 'Hubert', squaredDifference: 144}
]
</pre>
<p>How can you create a new array like this? If <em>only</em> there were a function that let you do some kind of transformation, or mapping
(<em>ahem</em>) of one array to another, whereby you create these new "squaredDifference" elements.
</p>
<p>
Your code will be structured like this:
</p>
<pre class="sample">
var average = // Create an array of scores, find its mean.
var squareDifferenceArray = []; 

// For each element:
// 1. Calculate the difference of the score minus the average.
// 2. Calculate the square of that value.
// 3. Add the squared value to the array. 
//    Remember, to add a object to an array you code something like:
//    squareDifferenceArray.push({name: someName, squaredDifference: someValue});

// Look in your debugger's console to see what you created
console.log(squareDifferenceArray); 
</pre>

<p>Think about it, and code it.</p>

<li>Finally, show the standard deviation
<p>The standard deviation is the square root of the sum of the squared differences. Square root
is calculated by using the built-in JavaScript <code>Math.sqrt()</code> function.</p>
<p>Show the standard deviation in an alert, or just using <code>console.log()</code>.
<p>By the way, the standard deviation is 355.6. Is that what you calculated?</p>
</li>

</ol>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p><code>Ext.Array</code> functions are groovy.</p>
