<p>
There are two use-cases for <code>override</code>
</p>
<div type="expander" caption="To patch bugs in source code you don't maintain" >
<p>
For example, if there's a bug in an Ext JS component method, and on the forums
you find a new method implementation, you'd use <code>override</code> to apply
the new method to your copy of Ext jS. Then in a later release, when the bug is 
officially fixed, you'd remove the override.
</p>
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="For internationalization" >
<p>
If you code your classes to use properties rather than literals, you can use
override to create internationalized values for those properties.
</p>
<p>
For example, in the French locale file, the "invalid text" value is coded as: 
</p>
<pre>
Ext.define("Ext.locale.fr.form.field.Base", {
    override: "Ext.form.field.Base",
    invalidText: "La valeur de ce champ est invalide"
});</pre>

</div>
