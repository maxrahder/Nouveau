Recall that <code>Ext.create()</code> works by saying "If the specified class is not in memory, get it."
When you've done a build, all classes should be in memory, so dynamic loading should no longer occur.
</p>
<p>
Even though the development environment is pretty good at warning you that a requires is missing, but some things may 
not be caught. Therefore, after building you may discover that some classes were not included in the build, usually due to a 
missing <code>requires:[]</code> entry in some class.

<p>
For example, if your code uses a model, yet you never specify the model in a controller's <code>models:[]</code>
or a <code>requires:[]</code>, then model won't be included in the build, and you'll get a run time error.
