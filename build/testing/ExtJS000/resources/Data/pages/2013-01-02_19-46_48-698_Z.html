<a href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/#!/guide" target="api">Guides</a>
 provide high-level descriptions and explanations of key Ext JS features. 
</p>
<p>
The difference between the API documentation and a Guide is that API documentation describes details for using a specific class. A guide may cover
how a set of classes are used together to accomplish a certain task. 
<p>
<p>
For example, the Guide on MVC explains the MVC file structure, and how
<code>Ext.app.Controller</code> is used with models, stores and components.
