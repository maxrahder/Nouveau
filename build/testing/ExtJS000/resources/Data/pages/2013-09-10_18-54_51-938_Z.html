<p>For example, <code>Ext.Date</code> contains this code:</p>
<pre>dayNames : [ "Sunday", "Monday", ..., "Saturday" ]</pre>
<p>The German local file contains this code:</p>
<pre>Ext.Date.dayNames = [ "Sonntag","Montag", ..., "Samstag" ];</pre>
<p>
If the German locale file is loaded after the Ext JS library is loaded, then those 
values are in effect.
