<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>In this lab you will code an update methods to your class. The <code>apply</code> method will contain a business rule. You will
	also code <code>update</code> methods that fire events as mammal properties change.</p>

<p>This lab builds on the previous lab. You can either continue editing your code from part one, or you can use
	<kbd>Labs/ClassSystemIntro/PartTwo</kbd> as a starting point.</p>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<ol>

	<li>Review the application
		<p>If you're using your own code from part one, then you already know what it does.</p>
		<p>
			If you're starting with "PartTwo", visit <a href="http://localhost/SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/Labs/ClassSystemIntro/PartTwo/" target="lab">Labs/ClassSystemIntro/PartTwo/</a>. This is the solution from the previous lab.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>Add an apply method to <code>Mammal</code>
		<p>
			Add an
			<code>applyName</code>
			method to
			<code>MyApp.taxonomy.Mammal</code>
			. Code the method to have a single parameter: 
			<dfn>name</dfn>.
		</p>
		<p>As discussed in lecture, the apply method will only return a value if a business rule is passed. Our business
			rule is that the name cannot be blank.</p>
		<p>
			Code the
			<code>applyName</code>
			method to have an
			<code>if</code>
			statement: If the passed
			<dfn>name</dfn>
			is non-blank, return the name.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you've coded it, save the file and refresh the browser. Then try it out. If you press Speak you should see the
			name, as before. If you erase the entire name field and press Speak, you should see the previous value, because the
			name was not successfully updated when an empty string was passed to your
			<code>applyName(name)</code>
			method.
		</p>

	</li>

	<li>Stop and savor your work
		<p>
			You're subclassing, overriding methods and have event handling. Life is good.
			<kbd>:-)</kbd>
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>But... there's a big flaw in the application
		<p>As you probably noticed, the application has a big flaw: as you change the mammal's name, none of the UI
			reflects the change. In other words, if you change the name to "Hubert", and press Speak, the alert works correctly
			because the mammal's name was actually changed. But the human panel title should also change, and so should the
			caption on the toolbar Speak sub-item.</p>
<p>Modify the <code>MyApp.taxonomy.Mammal</code> class: 
</p>
<ul class="plain">
<li>First, have it extend <code>Ext.util.Observable</code>. By making the mammal observable we can now run the ancestor <code>fireEvent()</code> method, which we'll see below.</li>
<li>Then add an <code>updateName()</code> function, with the following implementation.
This one also needs a require to <code>Ext.util.Observable</code>.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
updateName : function(newName, oldName){
    this.fireEvent('change', this);
}
</pre>
	</li>

	<li>Update the toolbar Speak sub-items
		<p>Now, let's add code to update the toolbar Speak sub-items. Right now, they are all stuck with the caption "J.
			Doe" or "Fluffy" even though you update the mammal's name in human or feline panel.</p>
		<p>
			To do this, you need to modify the
			<code>addMammal</code>
			method in <code>MyApp.view.MainPanel.js</code>. Down at the bottom of the method is the code that adds the Speak toolbar button sub-item.
			Modify it as follows:
		</p> <pre>
var menuItem = this.down('#speakButton').menu.add(speakSubItem);
mammal.on('change', function(mammal){
    menuItem.setText(mammal.getName());
});
		</pre>
		<p>
			The code used to simply add the sub-item. But the new code saves a reference to the new sub-item in a variable named
			<dfn>menuItem</dfn>
			, then adds an event handler to the mammal created earlier in the method. When the mammal fires the "change" event,
			our callback method will be run. The callback &mdash; or <em>event handler</em> &mdash; updates the menu item's text
			with the current value of the mammal (passed to the callback function).
		</p>
	</li>

	

	<li>Update the panel title too
		<p>The mammal and feline panels have a title, and it's still stuck with the name at the time of creation. It
			should also update as the name changes.</p>
		<p>
			The most logical and encapsulated place to do this is in
			<code>MammalPanel</code>
			.
		</p>
		<p>
			In <b>Labs/ClassSystemIntro/PartTwo/app/view/MammalPanel.js</b> modify the
			<code>initComponent</code>
			method. Add a couple of statements.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, define a local variable
			<code>var me = this;</code>
			We'll be coding a callback that's run when the mammal changes, and the code in the callback needs a reference to the
			panel. Within a function the value of <code>this</code> is based on how the function is being called. But we don't know what
			<code>this</code> will be set to in the callback. Therefore, we're defining the
			<dfn>me</dfn>
			variable so the code in the the callback will have a reference to the panel when the callback is run. This idiom of
			saving a reference to an object for use in callbacks is very common.
		</p>
		<p>
			Secondly, add the event handler by running
			<code>this.getMammal().on('change', function(mammal){});</code>
			You'll need a statement in the callback function that sets the panel title to the mammal's name. How do you set a
			panel's title? Well, you could guess, and you'd probably guess right. Or you can look in <a
				href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/#!/api/Ext.panel.Panel" target="api">API documentation.</a>
		</p>
		<p>Edit the code, save your changes and refresh your browser. In the running application choose human or feline,
			add it, and change the name. As you type the panel title should change. Cool!</p>

<h1>Optional</h1>


	<li>If you get insomnia later, here's another set of enhancements you might want to try
		<ul class="plain">
			<li>Create <code>MyApp.taxonomy.Canine</code>
                           <ul class="plain">
			     <li>Dogs should have the default name "Rover"</li>
			     <li>When dogs speak they bark</li>
			     <li>Add a boolean "happy" property to dogs</li>
			     <li>When happy dogs speak they bark more than usual</li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>
			<li>Create <code>MyApp.view.CaninePanel</code>
                           <ul class="plain">
                              <li>The canine panel should have a "Happy" checkbox</code></li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><code>MyApp.view.MainPanel</code> should be modified
                            <ul class="plain">
                               <li>Add <code>MyApp.taxonomy.Canine</code> and <code>MyApp.view.CaninePanel</code> to the requires array</li>
                               <li>Create a "Canine" type association</li>
                               <li>Add a new Canine button to the main menu</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Code it, and test by creating a dog, clicking Speak, then making the dog happy and clicking Speak again.</p>
	</li>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
	You are now a Ext JS OO master, having used

	, methods, update, apply, and event-handling via
	<code>Ext.util.Observable</code>
	.
