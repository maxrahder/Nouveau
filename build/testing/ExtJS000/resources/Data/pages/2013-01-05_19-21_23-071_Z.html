In a modular application, the components you use, are defined in their own source files.
For example, when you use a panel, you create an instance of a component defined by
someone at Sencha.

The same goes for your own components. Your major containers, and other reusable
components, will each be coded via <code>Ext.define()</code>. Your calling
routines will then create instances of your component class.
