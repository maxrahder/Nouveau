<pre>customerRecord.orders().load();</pre>
<p>
When you run <code>load()</code>, Ext JS uses the proxy for the associated model, 
and automatically passes the foreign key from the current record. 
</p>
<p>
The server looks at the foreign key, constructs a database query and returns the corresponding order
data.
