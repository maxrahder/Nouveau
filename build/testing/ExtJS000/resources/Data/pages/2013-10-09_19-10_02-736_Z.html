The starting point for an application is <code>Ext.application()</code>,
which creates the application's controllers and <code>Viewport</code>.
</p>
<p>
Controllers create stores and can hold control logic that coordinates events occurring
in the application's stores and components.
</p>
<p>The <code>Viewport</code> is the base container for the application &mdash; all
components are nested within the viewport.
