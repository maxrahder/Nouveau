<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>
Creating the SenchaTraining folder structure with Sencha Cmd.
</h2>
<p>
Before you can start with this lab, you must have a copy of the <b>course files</b> extracted in the root of your webserver (<b>htdocs</b>).
If your setup is not complete, ask your instructor for assistance or read the <a href="?page=Appendix > Setup and Organization > Course Files" target="api">instructions</a>.
</p>

<h1>Objectives</h1>
<ul class="plain">
<li>Generate an Ext JS workspace</li>
</ul>


<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
	<li>
		Install Sencha Cmd 3.1.2.342
		<p>
			In a terminal window, install Sencha Cmd 3.1.2.342 by typing the following:
			<pre>sencha upgrade 3.1.2.342</pre>
			Note: If you don't already have a Sencha Cmd version installed, download and install it:<br />
			<a href="http://cdn.sencha.com/cmd/3.1.2.342/SenchaCmd-3.1.2.342-osx.app.zip">OS X</a> | 
			<a href="http://cdn.sencha.com/cmd/3.1.2.342/SenchaCmd-3.1.2.342-windows.exe.zip">Windows</a> | 
			<a href="http://cdn.sencha.com/cmd/3.1.2.342/SenchaCmd-3.1.2.342-linux.run.zip">Linux(32 bit)</a> | 
			<a href="http://cdn.sencha.com/cmd/3.1.2.342/SenchaCmd-3.1.2.342-linux-x64.run.zip">Linux (64 bit)</a>
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		Verify your Sencha Cmd installation
		<p>
			Close any open terminal windows, then open a new terminal and type the following:
			<pre>sencha which</pre>
			If your Sencha Cmd version is newer than 3.1.2.342, navigate to the printed directory and run the "uninstall" script. Repeat this step until you are using version 3.1.2.342.
		</p>
	</li>

<li>Confirm you have the following folder structure in your <b>htdocs</b> folders:

<ul class="plain">
<li>SenchaTraining
<ul>
<li>ExtJS251
<ul>
<li>ext-4.2</li>
<li>Labs</li>
<li>LabSolutions</li>
<ul>
	<li>ext</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
We will start by generating a workspace.
<p>
Workspaces allow multiple applications to share the same Ext JS framework.
Throughout the week you'll be working on multiple labs, and each lab
is coded as its own application. By using a workspace, all the labs will
share the same framework. 
</p>
<p>Open your console/terminal and navigate to <kbd>htdocs/SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/ext-4.2</kbd></p>
<p>Run the following command.</p>
<pre>
sencha generate workspace ../Labs
</pre>
</li>

<li>
Confirm that the workspace was generated correctly
<p>
You will see 3 new folders in the Labs folder: 
</p>

<ul class="plain">
<li>A <kbd>.sencha</kbd> hidden folder that stores the Sencha Cmd workspace configuration, </li>
<li>a new <kbd>ext</kbd> folder which contains the framework libraries that all of your applications will use, and</li>
<li>a <kbd>packages</kbd> folder which will contain themes, plugins and locales.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, all applications coded under the ExtJS251/Labs
folder will share the <b>ext</b> install.</p>
<p>
You can test that it works, by opening one of the <a href="http://localhost/SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/Labs/Templates/
" target="_blank">Labs</a> in your browser.
</p> 
</li>
</ol>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this lab, you used Sencha Cmd to generate a new workspace. A workspace lets multiple applications share resources. You also reviewed the initial MVC file structure and verified the generated workspace with a pre-existing application.</p>
