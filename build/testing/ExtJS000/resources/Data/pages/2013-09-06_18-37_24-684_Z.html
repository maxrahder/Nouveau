<p>Themes are implemented as <i>packages</i>. There are three types of package:
<ul class="plain">
<li>Code</li>
<li>Locale</li>
<li>Theme</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The themes that ship with Ext JS are packages found within your <kbd>[workspace root]/ext/packages</kbd> folder.</p>
<p>You can also create your own packages in your <kbd>[workspace root]/packages</kbd> folder.</p>
