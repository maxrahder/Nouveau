    <li>We do not intend this unit to be an introductory course in Web programming. You should have already had that before taking this course. Rather, is intended to highlight some of what Web programmers need to know to write code in ExtJS.
        <li>Some of what we will cover includes:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>functions as objects</li>
            <li>function arguments</li>
            <li>special variables such as <code>arguments</code> and <code>this</code></li>
            <li>scope</li>
            <li><code>this.callParent(arguments)</code> which is Sencha's super() method</li>
            <li>Sencha objects</li>
            <li>prototypal chaining</li>
        </ul>
</ul>
