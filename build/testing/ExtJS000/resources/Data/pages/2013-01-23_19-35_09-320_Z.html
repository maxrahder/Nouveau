<p>
The <code>plugins</code> config is introduced at the <code>Ext.Component</code>. 
The only requirement for a plugin is that the plugin object have an <code>init</code>
method that takes a reference to a component. 
</p>
<p>
If you specify a plugin (or array of plugins), upon component creation, the component
will call each plugin's <code>init</code> method, passing a reference to itself. 
The plugin is then free to do whatever it wants: it may add DOM content, it may 
react to component events, etc.
