<p>
Ext JS soft-codes strings shown to the user. Those values are coded as properties, which 
can be overwritten by loading one of the locale files that ship with Ext JS.
</p>
<p>Ext JS ships with over 40 locale files, found in the 
<kbd>packages/ext-locale/build/</kbd> folder. 
</p>
<p>
Examples include <kbd>ext-lang-de.js</kbd>, <kbd>ext-lang-fr.js</kbd> and
many others.
