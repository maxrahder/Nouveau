<div type="expander" caption="How: A search may be initiated in many ways">
<p>Over time, your designers may change their minds about <em>how</em> 
a search is initiated:
</p>
<ul class="plain">
<li>Clicking a Search button.</li>
<li>Pressing the Enter key</li>
<li>After typing a certain number of characters</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div type="expander" caption="What: The view fires a high-level event">
<p>
Since there are many ways of initiating the search, the page should fire 
its own logical "search" event whenever the search is initiated &mdash;
no matter how it was done.
</p>
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="Controllers no longer care about <i>how</i>">
<p>
By doing this, the controller no longer cares <em>how</em> the search 
was initiated by the user.
</p>
</div>
