<p>Running <code>sencha app build</code> creates a new <kbd>.css</kbd> file that reflects 
the application's specified theme package and any additional theming done in the application's
 <kbd>sass/</kbd> folder. 
</p>
<p>By default, the generated <kbd>.css</kbd> is minimized. Specify <kbd>testing</kbd> to generate an un-minimized <kbd>.css</kbd> file.</p>
<p>
Only CSS classes used by your application are included. For example, if 
your application doesn't have a tree panel, then no tree panel CSS classes are included.</p>
<p style="clear: both"><small>(Cmd also creates a <kbd>.js</kbd> file of those classes used by your application &mdash;
we'll talk about that in the next topic.)</small></p>
