<p>
Controllers have a <code>refs</code> property that allows you to put a name on 
a selector. The name can then be used as a getter in your controller methods.
</p>
<p>For example, if you had a text field with the <code>itemId</code> mySearchField, 
you could code this ref:
</p>
<div class="readonly">
<pre class="runnable">
refs : [ {
    ref : 'searchField',
    selector : 'mypanel #mySearchField'
} ]</pre>
</div>
<p>
As a result, in your controller methods you can then get a reference to the component
via <code>this.getSearchField()</code>.
