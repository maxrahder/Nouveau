<ul>
<li><code>dockedItems</code> is an array of components, each tagged with <code>dock</code></li>
<li><code>dock</code> specifies the dock position: top, right, bottom, left
</li>
<li>You'll probably only dock toolbars</li>
</ul>

<p>There is simpler syntax we'll see in a minute, so even though toolbars are commonly docked, the <code>dockedItems</code> config itself is rarely seen.</p>
