<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>In this lab, you will finish coding a view, and then code a controller.</p>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<ol>

	<li>Preview the application you'll be writing
		<p>
			In your browser, visit <a href="http://localhost/SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/LabSolutions/MVC/Twitter" target="_blank">the application you will be
				writing.</a>
		</p>
		<p>The application retrieves Twitter searches. Type a string into the search field and press the Search button.</p>
	</li>

	<li>Here's the flow
		<p>
			<img src="resources/diagrams/BigPictureLab.jpg">
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a model-view-controller application. The <em>model</em> is the store and its associated record declaration.
			The <em>view</em> is a top-level viewport and the grid panel. The <em>controller</em> "listens" to user clicks on the
			search button, and loads the store with the tweets that match the search string. Since the grid also observes the
			store, it automatically updates as the data changes.
	</li>

	<li>Inspect <kbd>Labs/MVC/Twitter/index.html</kbd>
		<p>In your IDE, open <kbd>Labs/MVC/index.html</kbd>. It contains a reference to the Ext JS style sheet,
			and an Ext JS library and "app.js".</p>
	</li>

	<li>Inspect <kbd>Labs/MVC/Twitter/app.js</kbd>
		<p>
			<kbd>app.js</kbd> usually doesn't have much code. In our case, it is configured to automatically create our viewport. It also
			has a
			<code>launch()</code>
			function, where you can do on-startup initialization.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>Inspect the view
		<p>
			In your editor open <kbd>Labs/MVC/Twitter/app/view/Viewport.js</kbd>. The view is stubbed out, with its
			<code>html</code>
			config property set to "The grid will go here". In this lab you will replace that code with code that creates an
			instance of
			<code>TwitterGrid</code>
			.
		</p>
		<p>The other file in the <kbd>view</kbd> folder is <kbd>Labs/MVC/Twitter/app/view/TwitterGrid.js</kbd>. Open it and note that
			it defines a grid subclass. The columns are already defined. It has an xtype. The toolbar definition is missing.
	</li>

	<li>Run it
		<p>
			In your web browser, go to the Labs folder, and select <a href="http://localhost/SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/Labs/MVC/Twitter/" target="lab">
				Labs/MVC/Twitter/</a>. You will see a page that says "The grid will go here."
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>Look at the Twitter data

		<p>
			We will be getting JSON data from Twitter via its "search" API. Take a look <a
				href="http://yelp.senchabits.com/go?fn=twitter&q=extjs" target="_blank">at the data</a>. It's a JSON string, and buried
			in the response is a "results" property, which is an array of objects. Each of these is a tweet. Our code will
			convert each tweet into a record, and the records will be added to a data store.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>Inspect the model

		<p>
			Recall from the diagram that the model has two parts: the record declaration and the store. In Ext JS records are
			defined using the
			<code>Ext.data.Model</code>
			class. Stores are defined in
			<code>Ext.data.Store</code>
			.
		</p>
		<p>
			In your editor, open <kbd>Labs/MVC/Twitter/app/model/Tweet.js</kbd>. We have provided the complete model declaration. A
			<code>Ext.data.Model</code>
			describes a record. In this case, it describes some of the data Twitter provides in a tweet. The model declaration
			also describes the URL for the data, and the location of the tweets array in the data feed.
		</p>
		<p>In the "store" folder open <kbd>Labs/MVC/Twitter/app/store/Tweets.js</kbd>. It specifies the model used to
			populate it.</p>
	</li>

	<li>Inspect the controller

		<p>
			In your editor, open "Labs/MVC/Twitter/app/controller/TwitterController.js" Note that the
			<code>searchHandler</code>
			method has already been coded. It re-loads the store by passing the user-entered search string to Twitter.
		</p>
		<p>In a minute, you will add code here that detects "click" events on the Search button, and loads data using the
			string entered in the search field.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Add the grid to the viewport

		<p>
			The viewport is stubbed out to show "The grid will go here." Replace the
			<code>html</code>
			property with the grid using this code:
		</p> <pre>
items : [{
    xtype : 'twittergrid'
}]</pre>
		<p>
			This creates an instance of the grid defined in <kbd>view/TwitterGrid.js</kbd> &mdash; the
			<code>xtype</code>
			specified in the items array matches the value we defined in the grid.
		</p>
		<p>Save your changes and refresh your browser. You should see an empty grid. You should no longer see "The grid
			will go here."</p>
	</li>


	<li>Add the search toolbar to the grid
		<p>Add a top-toolbar to the grid. The toolbar has two items: a text field and a button. We haven't covered text
			fields yet, so for that item just copy and paste this code:</p> <pre>{
    xtype : 'textfield',
    itemId : 'searchText',
    fieldLabel : 'Search'
}</pre>
		<p>
			For the search button, recall what you learned in the "Foundation | Panels and Buttons" topic. Or <a
				href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/#!/api/Ext.panel.Panel-cfg-tbar" target="api">look in the API
				documentation</a>. The button should be labeled "Search" and have an icon referencing "find.png". We've used a larger image for the Search icon. See if you can figure out how to make it display properly.
			Give the button an
			<code>itemId</code>
			of "twitterSearch". We will use the itemId in the controller to select the button.
		<p>Save your changes and refresh. You should see the toolbar on the grid.</p>
	</li>

	<li>Have the controller process the search
		<p>
			In your IDE open <kbd>controller/TwitterController.js</kbd> and add code to the
			<code>init</code>
			function. Recall that in
			<code>init</code>
			you call
			<code>this.control()</code>
			passing an object that specifies a component selector and the associated events you want to listen to.
		</p>
		<p>
			Write a selector that selects the twitter grid (using its xtype) and the button within it (using its
			<code>itemId</code>
			). The code would work with an
			<code>itemId</code>
			reference alone, since our simple application only has one component with that
			<code>itemId</code>
			. But in general, selecting on
			<code>itemId</code>
			alone would be too general, and would match any component within the application with the
			<code>itemId</code>
			.
		</p>
		<p>
			For help on writing the
			<code>init()</code>
			method, review lecture slides or see The documentation for <a
                href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/#!/api/Ext.app.Controller-cfg-stores" target="api">Ext.app.Controller</a>.
                
                Another helpful reference is <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/#!/guide/application_architecture-section-3" target="api">the
				section on "Writing a Controller" in the application architecture guide</a>.
		</p>
		<p>Save your changes and refresh. There grid and toolbar should still be there, but now they're functional!</p>
	</li>

	<li>That's it!
		<p>Try it out. Type a search term and press Find.</p>
	</li>

</ol>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
	You have "wired up" the pieces of a model-view-controller application. If you type a search string, and press Find, the
	controller's
	<code>searchHandler</code>
	method is run. It has the store re-load, by calling Twitter, passing the search string. Since the grid shows the store,
	it automatically changes as the store changes.
