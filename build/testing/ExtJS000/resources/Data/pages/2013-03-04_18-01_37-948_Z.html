<h1>Steps</h1>

<ol>

	<li>Code the model for the school list
		<p>First, we will retrieve the data used in the School combo
			box. The feed for schools returns data that looks like this:</p> <pre>{
    "data" : [ {
            "id" : 15,
            "name" : "Brown",
            "fullname" : "Brown University",
            "latitude" : 41.82703,
            "longitude" : -71.40304
        }, {
            "id" : 13,
            "name" : "Cal Poly",
            "fullname" : "California Polytechnic State University",
            "latitude" : 35.288299,
            "longitude" : -120.65958
        }, {
            ...
    }]
}</pre>
		<p>Therefore, we need a model named "School" with the fields id,
			name, fullname, latitude and longitude. Sencha Cmd can create this
			via the following command. Note that spaces are <b>not</b> allowed in the list of field names.</p> <pre>sencha generate model School id,name,fullname,latitude,longitude</pre>

<p>Using your source code editor open
			<kbd>model/School.js</kbd>. Our model definition needs a proxy, coded like this:</p><pre>proxy: {
    type: 'ajax',
    url: 'http://yelp.senchabits.com/go?fn=schoollist',
    reader: {
        type: 'json',
        root: 'data'
    }
}</pre>

<p>The reader <code>root</code> config specifies the data feed 
property that has the array of record data.</p>

	<li>Now code the Schools store
		
<p>Create a new file named <kbd>store/Schools.js</kbd>. In it, define a new class named <code>YelpExtplorer.store.Schools</code> that extends <code>Ext.data.Store</code>. Besides the <code>extend</code> class descriptor, the class has two configs:  <code>model:'YelpExtplorer.model.School'</code> and <code>autoLoad:true</code>.</p>
<p>
Note that <i>some</i> piece of code needs to load the model class. We could
do that in the <code>models</code> array of the controller, in the
<code>models</code> array of the application, or the store declaration
in its <code>requires</code> array. Since it's the store that needs the
model, it makes sense to use the store's <code>requires</code> array &mdash;
add that to your declaration of <code>YelpExtplorer.store.Schools</code>.

</p>
</li>

	<li>Add a controller to manage the school selection
		<p>Use Sencha Cmd to generate a controller named "Filter".</p> <pre>sencha generate controller Filter</pre>
		<p>After you create it, use your text editor to open
			<kbd>controller/Filter.js</kbd>. There is not a lot there!</p>
		<p>To have your Schools store loaded and created by the
			controller, add a <code>stores</code> array with one entry, "Schools".</p>
<p>You also need to have the controller loaded and created. That's done from the application. Open <kbd>app/application.js</kbd> and add "Filter" to the <code>controllers</code> array.
		
	</li>

	<li>Verify network traffic
		<p>Once you have made the changes above, you can refresh your
			browser. There is no change in the user interface, but if you look in
			the debugger at network traffic you should see the URL being fired
			and the server's response.</p>
		<p>You can also inspect the store by going to the debugger console
			and typing "Ext.getStore('Schools');" If you drill down into the
			store's data.items array you should see the 29 records in the store.</p>
	</li>

	<li>Add the Schools combo box to the filter panel
		<p>The list of schools will be shown in a combo box at the top of the
			Filter panel.</p>
		<p>To code this, open <kbd>view/Filter.js</kbd> in your editor. Change its
			<code>extend</code> descriptor to "Ext.panel.Panel". (If you were to save and refresh your
			browser, you would see the "Filter" panel title.)</p>

		<p>Add a <code>tbar</code> containing a single item, a combo box. We haven't
			talked about form fields yet, so just use this code:</p> <pre>{
    xtype : 'combobox',
    itemId : 'schoolCombo',
    fieldLabel : 'University',
    labelWidth : 60,
    width : 180,
    emptyText : 'Select',
    store : 'Schools',
    queryMode: 'local',
    displayField : 'name',
    valueField : 'id'    
} </pre>
		<p>
			Note a few things: The combo box will show the data from the Schools
			store. By specifying the name of the store, the combo box
			automatically fetches a reference using
			<code>Ext.getStore()</code>
			. The values shown in the dropdown are specified by the
			<code>displayField</code> property. The associated value is specified via
			<code>valueField</code>. We are using an <code>itemId</code> so we can select the combo box
			in the controller.
		</p>
		<p>After making those changes, save and refresh your browser. You
			should see the Schools combo box in the west panel. Select the
			dropdown and you will see the list of the schools in the Schools store.</p>
		<p>Note that since you're using the xtype for combobox, you're
			getting the warning about needing a requires array. Add that to the
			<code>YelpExtplorer.view.Filter</code> class descriptor.</p>
<pre>requires: ['Ext.form.field.ComboBox']</pre>

	</li>

	<li>Define the Business model
		<p>Now that the user can select the school, you need code to fetch
			corresponding businesses. That means you need a new model and store, and controller logic
			that detects the school selection.</p>
		<p>Here is what the business data looks like in the feed:</p> <pre>{
    "business_id" : "4L8sk1KU1tsHEVImKgGv8Q",
    "full_address" : "602 W University Ave\nUrbana, IL 61801",
    "categories" : [ "Doctors", "Health and Medical", "Internal Medicine" ],
    "photo_url" : "http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/assets/2/www/img/...gif",
    "review_count" : 3,
    "name" : "Kyrouac Jeffrey MD",
    "url" : "http://www.yelp.com/biz/kyrouac-jeffrey-md-urbana",
    "longitude" : -88.214384,
    "stars" : 5,
    "latitude" : 40.116792
}
</pre>
<p>Use Sencha Cmd to define a new model named "Business" using the following statement. This is a single long statement, so you may see a line wrap in your browser. Spaces are <b>not</b> allowed in the list of fields.</p>
<pre>sencha generate model Business business_id,full_address,categories,photo_url,review_count,name,url,longitude,stars,latitude
</pre>

		<p>Open <kbd>model/Business.js</kbd>. In the feed, the business id is in a property named "business_id". So add an <code>idProperty</code> attribute with that name.</p>
		<p>You also need to add the proxy. The feed is nested in a "data"
			property, just like the school feed. Therefore, the proxy is
			identical to the one for the School, except that the URL is a little
			different. Here is the proxy:</p> <pre>proxy : {
    type : 'ajax',
    url : 'http://yelp.senchabits.com/go?fn=schoolbiz',
    reader : {
        type : 'json',
        root : 'data'
    }
}</pre>
	</li>

	<li>Add the Businesses store
		<p>Create <kbd>store/Businesses.js</kbd> and define the store. This is
			similar to the Schools store, except we want the data to be sorted.
			Therefore, code a <code>sorters</code> array property with one value, "name".
			See if you can figure this code out for yourself. Remember to also set the
			model to "YelpExtplorer.model.Business". And also load the model by adding
a <code>requires</code> array, like you did for <code>Schools</code>.</p>
<p>
Sencha Cmd does not have an option to generate a store, so you'll have to code this entirely by hand.
</p>
	</li>

	<li>Add the controller logic to detect the combo box change and
		fetch the corresponding businesses

<p>Open <kbd>controller/Filter.js</kdb> in your code editor.</p>

<p>
Since you'll be loading the Businesses store as the user selects a school from the combobox, 
you need to load and create the Businesses store. Do that by adding "Businesses" to the controller's <code>stores</code> array. </p>

<p>To detect changes to the school combobox you'll need to call <code>control</code>, specifying
a selector for the combobox, and the events you're detecting. Add this code:
<pre>init: function() {
    this.control({
        'yepfilter #schoolCombo': {
            change: this.onSchoolChange
        }
    });
}</pre>

<p>The selector is specifying the xtype for the filter panel, and the
<code>itemId</code> for the combobox.</p>

<p>Now you need to code the <code>onSchoolChange</code> method.

		</p> 
<pre>onSchoolChange: function(combo, newValue, oldValue) {
    console.log('onSchoolChange');
}</pre>

		<p>Save and refresh your browser. You should see the console log
			being run as you select schools in the dropdown. If you don't, have
			your instructor take a look at your code.</p>

		<p>
			Once you verify
			<code>onSchoolChange</code>
			is being run, modify it to reflect this logic. This code loads the businesses store, using the selected
			school ID.
		<pre>onSchoolChange: function(combo, newValue, oldValue) {
    var school = this.getSchoolsStore().getById(newValue);
    this.getBusinessesStore().load({
        params: {
            schoolid: school.getId()
        }
    });
}</pre>

		<p>Note that the event handler is referencing the businesses store via <code>this.getBusinessesStore()</code> &mdash; that getter is created automatically because
"Businesses" is specified in the controller's <code>stores</code> array. 
		</p>

	</li>



	<li>We are almost finished!
		<p>Now we want to have the map show the school's businesses.</p>
		<p>To do that, we first need to add a Google libraries to the
			application. Edit <kbd>index.html</kbd> and add this line to the &lt;head&gt; 
section:</p> <pre>&lt;script src="http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?libraries=geometry&sensor=false"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
	
<p><small><b>Note: </b>Place this directly after the opening head tag. If you place, it between the comments, that is generated code by Cmd and it will cause your build to fail later in the week.</small></p>	
<p>
			Then add two things to the <code>Filter</code> controller. First, add a reference to the map panel. </p>
<pre>
refs: [{
    ref: 'map',
    selector: 'yepmap'
}]
</pre>

                <p>Save and refresh, to make sure there are no syntax errors.</p>
		<p>
			Then, add this code to the end of the
			<code>onSchoolChange</code> method:
<pre>
this.getMap().centerMap( school.get('latitude'), school.get('longitude') );</pre>
		<p>This code gets a reference to the map, using the "ref" you just
			created, and runs a method that centers the map at the specified
			location.</p>
		<p>Save, refresh and select a school. You should see the map
			centered at the school's location.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Modify Main view to pass Businesses store to Map
		<p>The map class is pre-coded to reflect the store's records. To
			make this work, edit <kbd>view/Main.js</kbd> and add <code>store:'Businesses'</code> to
			the config for the map. That way the map knows about the store,
			and should plot a marker for each business.</p><pre>{
    xtype: 'yepmap',
    title: 'Map',
    store : 'Businesses'
}</pre>
			
		<p>Make the change, save and refresh. Then select a school. You
			should see all its nearby businesses marked in a Google map!</p>
	</li>
	<li>Add a ref for the school combo box so you can set the initial selection
		<p>Edit <kbd>controller/Filter</kbd> and add to <code>refs</code>.
</p>
<pre>
{
    ref: 'schoolCombo',
    selector: 'yepfilter #schoolCombo'
}
</pre>

	<li>Automatically select a school when store is loaded
		<p>Edit <kbd>controller/Filter</kbd> and add to the <code>init</code> function listening for the <code>load</code> event.
<pre>
this.getSchoolsStore().on('load', this.onSchoolsLoad, this);
</pre>

        <p>Write the event handler 
 <code>onSchoolsLoad</code> to set the initial selection in the combo box.</p>
<pre>onSchoolsLoad: function(store, records) {
    var combo = this.getSchoolCombo();
    var school = store.findRecord('name', 'Illinois');
    combo.setValue(school); // Triggers the combobox change event
}</pre>

<p>You're free to choose any initial school: UC Berkeley, Stanford, Cal Tech, Cornell, Michigan, Maryland or any of the schools listed in the combobox.</p>
			
		<p>Make the change, save and refresh. The first school should now load automatically and populate the combo box and the map!</p>
	</li>

</ol>




<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>You did a lot in this lab! You used Sencha Cmd extensively to
	generate models and controllers, added event handling to the control
	and added "refs" to the controller. You defined a store, and added
	static properties and calculated field to a model.</p>
<p>The YelpExtplorer application is really starting to do things!</p>
