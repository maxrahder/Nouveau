<ul>
<li>Ext JS uses these powerful low-level classes to create panels, buttons and the other components you need in your application</li>
<li>You may occasionally use them
  <ul>
    <li>If you code direct <code>Ext.Component</code> subclasses you'll probably needs to get into the details of the DOM</li>
    <li>If you have legacy content, you can use these commands to select and manipulate that content</li>
    <li>But the whole <em>point</em> of a component library is so you don't need to worry about the DOM very much!</li>
  </ul>
