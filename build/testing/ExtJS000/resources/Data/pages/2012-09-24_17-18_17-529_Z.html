<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
	This lab will let you define a class. You'll use
	<code>config</code>
	to automatically generate accessor methods. You'll also override a method.
</p>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<ol>

	<li>Run the application
		<p>
			Use your browser to browse <a href="http://localhost/SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/Labs/ClassSystemIntro/PartOne/" target="lab">Labs/ClassSystemIntro/PartOne/</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The application is a panel, with two buttons in its toolbar: Human and Speak. If you click the first button, a new
			instance of
			<code>MyApp.taxonomy.Human</code>
			is created, and a panel is added that shows the person's name, along with a button that has has the person speak.
		</p>
		<p>Try it: Click Human, and on the new panel click Speak. You should see alert that says "Hi there, my name is J.
			Doe. I am not married." In the panel, change the person's name and marital status, click Speak, and you should see
			those changes reflected in the message.</p>

		<p>The toolbar also has a Speak button. It gets updated with new sub-items as new humans or felines are added.
			Clicking on a Speak sub-item will have the corresponding person or cat speak. We'll talk more about these buttons
			later.</p>
	</li>

	<li>Try creating a cat
		<p>Note that the Human button is actually a split button. If you click on the drop-down you'll see there are two
			sub-items: Human and Feline. Choosing one or the other sets the type of mammal you create.</p>
		<p>Switch to Feline, and create one. You'll see a new panel, but the name of the cat is "Creature" and clicking
			Speak shows an alert that says "Ugh!"</p>
		<p>
			Something's wrong! We <em>should</em> be seeing something appropriate for cats, not some creature. You'll be adding
			code to get the feline class working correctly.
		</p>

	</li>

	<li>Look at the project
		<p>In your code editor, look at <kbd>Labs/ClassSystemIntro/PartOne/</kbd>.</p>
		<p>The project is structured like a MVC application, with source classes organized into packages.</p>
		<p>The mammal classes are in the "taxonomy" package. The main panel, and other panels, are in the "view" package.</p>
	</li>

	<li>Look at the code that adds people and cats
		<p>
			For the purposes of this lab, the details of the UI don't matter too much, but in your editor look at
			<kbd>Labs/ClassSystemIntro/PartOne/app/view/MainPanel.js</kbd>. The method that creates humans or felines is
			<code>addMammal</code>
			.
		</p>
		<p>
			Look at
			<code>addMammal</code>
			. The code sees whether Human or Feline is shown on the split button, determines the data types associated with that
			value, creates the human or feline, and adds the associated panel to the main panel. It also adds a sub-item to the
			Speak button on the toolbar.
		</p>
		<p>
			This code is complete. It <em>is</em> creating humans and felines, but the feline class itself is incomplete.
		</p>
	<li>Look at the feline class
		<p>
			Open <kbd>Labs/ClassSystemIntro/PartOne/app/taxonomy/Feline.js</kbd> The code is syntactically correct, and the class extends <code>MyApp.taxonomy.Mammal</code>, as it should, but it doesn't add any new properties or methods for cats. That's why the new cat acts just like a mammal.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>Look at the mammal class
		<p>
			Open <kbd>Labs/ClassSystemIntro/PartOne/app/taxonomy/Mammal.js</kbd>. Mammals have a
			<code>config</code>
			for name, and a
			<code>speak()</code>
			method. Note two things:
		<ul>
			<li style="font-weight: normal;"><code>speak()</code> references the mammal's name, via <code>this.getName()</code>.
				That's an example of an accessor method being automatically generated because of the corresponding property in <code>config</code>.</li>
			<li style="font-weight: normal;"><code>Mammal</code> has a constructor, with the two boilerplate statements
				discussed in lecture &mdash; when coding your own class hierarchy, your base class needs the call to <code>this.initConfig(config);</code>
				and any constructor needs a call to the ancestor constructor via <code>this.callParent(arguments);</code></li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>Give your cats a more appropriate default name
		<p>
			Modify the feline class to use a more appropriate cat name. "Fluffy" is the obvious choice. How does one set the
			initial value of a property? Look at the code for mammal, and use the same
			<code>config</code>
			property in
			<code>Feline</code>
			, but specify an initial value of "Fluffy", rather then "Creature".
		</p>
		<p>Save your changes and refresh your browser. Then choose Feline from the dropdown, and create a cat. The title
			of the panel should reflect the new default name. </p>
	</li>

	<li>Give your cats a more appropriate way of speaking
		<p>
			Add a
			<code>speak</code>
			in
			<code>MyApp.taxonomy.Feline</code>
			. This should be similar to what's in
			<code>MyApp.taxonomy.Mammal</code>
			, but rather than saying "Ugh!", cats should show an alert that shows something like 'Fluffy says "Meow"'
		</p>
		<p>
			Save your changes and refresh your browser. Choose Feline from the dropdown, create a cat and press Speak. Your new
			<code>speak</code>
			method should be run.
		</p>
		<p class="small">Remember: if your code isn't working the way you think it should, ask your instructor to take a look.</p>
	</li>

	<h1>Optional</h1>

	<li>Inspect how <code>HumanPanel</code> is structured
		<p>
			In your editor, open <kbd>Labs/ClassSystemIntro/PartOne/app/view/MammalPanel.js</kbd> and look at the
			<code>getButtonsArray</code>
			method. This is called in
			<code>initComponent</code>
			to specify the panel buttons. There's also a
			<code>getItems</code>
			method used to specify the items in the panel &mdash; in
			<code>MyApp.view.MammalPanel</code>
			there's a text field that shows the mammal's name.
		</p>
		<p>
			In your editor, open <kbd>Labs/ClassSystemIntro/PartOne/app/view/HumanPanel.js</kbd> and look at the
			<code>getItems</code>
			method. This code results in human panels having more items than the ancestor. The method calls the parent class
			<code>getItems</code> (<code>var result = this.callParent();</code>)
			method to get the array defined in the ancestor, then pushes a new value onto the array, and returns the result.
			That's why human panels have the additional "Married" check box.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>Add a Yodel button to human panels
		<p>
			When you looked at
			<code>MyApp.taxonomy.Human</code>
			you may have noticed that humans can yodel. We need a button that runs that!
		</p>
		<p>
			In your editor, open <kbd>view/HumanPanel.js</kbd>. Code an
			<code>getButtonsArray</code>
			method. This overrides the method of the same name in
			<code>MammalPanel</code>
			. The new method should get the parent button array and add an additional button config for yodeling.
		</p>
		<p>As a guideline, the solution this method has three statements of code. With pretty whitespace and indentation
			it has eight lines.</p>
		<p>Look at the human panel <code>getItems</code> method for ideas. The Yodel button needs a handler,
		with one line of code: <code>button.up('humanpanel').getMammal().yodel();</code></p>
		<p>If you get stuck, call your instructor or peek at the solution.</p>
	</li>

</ol>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
	You coded a sub-class, with a
	<code>config</code>
	specifying a default value. You also coded a method override.
