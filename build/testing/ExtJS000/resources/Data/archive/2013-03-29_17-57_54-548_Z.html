<p><strong>Help Documentation</strong><br />
A bit weak from Sublime but the Unofficial documentation from the community is quite good. Help area is also the area to get the info on submitting your own packages. The <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/" target="_blank">Sublime Forum</a> is a very active community.</p>

  Hope the information was useful to you.<em><strong> The Sencha Training Team</strong></em></p>
