<p>There are a couple of factors that affect performance</p>
<div type="expander" caption="Network latency" >
<p>This affects initial startup time heavily, but also data store load time.</p>
<p>
The solution is to use the Sencha Cmd: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a single, concatenated JavaScript file containing all the required JavaScript used by the application</li>
<li>Build a minified CSS stylesheet that uses only mixins for the used components.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div type="expander" caption="CSS Processing" >
<p>
A CSS selector like <code>.HeaderContainer .nav span</code>
will be processed, and an attempt made to match it on every span in the document. 
It’s much more efficient to use a single, identifying class name on elements to be styled.
</p>
</div>
<div type="expander" caption="JavaScript execution" >
<p>
There are several points to bear in mind when optimizing performance of JavaScript code:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid older or badly written JavaScript engines.</li>
<li>Optimize code which is repeated frequently.</li>
<li>Optimize code which is executed at render or layout time.</li>
<li>Better still, try not to execute any extra code at initial render or layout time.</li>
<li>Move invariant expressions outside of loops</li>
<li>Use <code>for</code> rather than <code>Ext.Array.each</code></li>
<li>If a function performs its task conditionally and is frequently called, check the condition outside the call, and only call it if necessary. (See calls to fireEvent in Ext JS codebase)</li>
<li>Setup and teardown of a call frame (apparatus needed to make a function call) is slow on bad JavaScript engines</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div type="expander" caption="DOM manipulation" >
It’s important to reduce container/component nesting to avoid unwanted layout runs and DOM reflows.<br/>
For example; when you have a <code>TabPanel</code> and you want to add a <code>Grid</code>, don't wrap it with an extra <code>Panel</code>. A grid already extends <code>Ext.panel.Panel</code>. 
</div>
