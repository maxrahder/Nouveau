<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
	In this lab, you'll use
	<code>Ext.onReady()</code>
	to create a grid. You'll also play around with various ways of organizing your code.
</p>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<ol>

	<li>Inspect <kbd>Labs/onReady/index.html</kbd>
		<p>
			In your IDE, open <kbd>Labs/onReady/index.html</kbd>. Note the
			<code>&lt;script&gt;</code>
			tag containing JavaScript that defines a model and store and a grid.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>Run it
		<p>In your web browser, go to the labs folder, and select the <kbd>onReady</kbd> folder. Since web servers load <kbd>index.html</kbd> by default, the code you inspected in the previous step is loaded by the browser, and its script tags run. You should see the grid, showing the data in the data store.</p>
		<p>In your debugger, right click on the grid and choose Inspect Element. You'll see a lot of complicated DIVs.
			That's the DOM Ext JS created to render the grid. There are also associated CSS styles that give the DOM elements
			heights, widths, borders, background colors, and the rest of their styling.</p>
	</li>

	<li>Break it a little
		<p>
			For kicks, go to <kbd>index.html</kbd> and change the link tag that references the Ext JS style sheet,
			<kbd>/SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/Labs/packages/ext-theme-neptune/build/resources/ext-theme-neptune-all.css</kbd>
			. Change the <code>href</code> and make it point to a non-existent file by putting an "X" in the middle of the name.
		</p>
		<p>
			Save <kbd>index.html</kbd> and refresh your browser. In your debugger look for a 404 HTTP error &mdash; that's the browser
			letting you know it couldn't find the style sheet. Note that the grid's information is there, but it's messed up.
			Choose Inspect Element again. The DOM is there, <em>exactly</em> as before, but it takes both DOM and styling to
			render a component.
		</p>
		<p>Go back to <kbd>index.html</kbd> and correct the reference to the CSS. Save, and refresh your browser window to make
			sure the grid is back to normal.</p>
	</li>

	<li>Start to modularize your code
		<p>
			There are four things in the code: the definitions of the model, store and grid, and the
			<code>onReady()</code>
			that actually creates and shows the grid.
		</p>
		<p>
			Start to modularize the code by moving each into its own
			<code>&lt;script&gt;</code>
			tag. To do this, add three new script tags above the tag containing the Ext JS code. Move the model definition into the
			first, move the store definition into the second, the grid definition into the third, and leave the
			<code>Ext.onReady()</code>
			in the fourth.
		</p>
		<p>
			When you are finished, <kbd>index.html</kbd> should have four script tags: one referencing <kbd>ext-all-dev.js</kbd>, one containing the
			model definition, one with the store, and one with the
			<code>Ext.onReady() and the grid.</code>
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>Run it
		<p>We've re-arranged things a little, but nothing has really changed. Everything should work.</p>
	</li>

	<li>What does the <code>Ext.onReady()</code> do?
		<p>
			<code>Ext.onReady()</code>
			is used when showing components. Components render in the DOM. The callback function passed to
			<code>onReady()</code>
			isn't run until the DOM is ready and all required classes have been loaded.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that the scripts defining the model store and grid are now outside of the
			<code>Ext.onReady()</code>
			. That works because this code isn't trying to render anything, and therefore, has nothing to do with the DOM.
			Therefore, defining those things can happen any time.
		</p>
		<p>
			To illustrate this, comment out the start and end of the call to
			<code>onReady()</code>
			. In other words, comment out the line that reads
			<code>Ext.onReady(function()</code>
			and the line with the matching closing braces that reads
			<code>});</code>
			.
<p>In JavaScript, <code>//</code> designates a single-line comment &mdash; everything on a line after a double-slash is ignored.</p>
		</p>
		<p>Save <kbd>index.html</kbd> and refresh the page. You should see a blank page. That's because the code for the grid was
			run before the document body had been loaded by the browser.</p>

		<p>Remove your comments, save and refresh. Ensure your page is showing the grid again before going to the next
			step.</p>

	</li>

	<li>To further illustrate the point...
		<p>Consider this code. Don't code anything &mdash; just read it.</p> <pre>
&lt;script&gt;
var store = Ext.create('MyApp.store.People');
var grid = Ext.create('MyApp.view.PeopleGrid',{
    title : 'Beatles',
    store : store
});
<b>Ext.onReady(function() {
    grid.render(Ext.getBody());
});</b>
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
		<p>
			The code runs fine even though practically everything has been moved out of the
			<code>onReady()</code>
			. The point is that it's not until things need to be rendered that the
			<code>onReady()</code>
			is important.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the other hand, there's no down side to putting more things in the
			<code>onReady()</code>
			&mdash; just code in a way that's easy to understand and maintain.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>Move the reference to <kbd>ext-all-dev.js</kbd></code>

		<p>
			Move the script tag for <kbd>ext-all-dev.js</kbd> below the other scripts. Save and refresh the browser. You'll get an error
			saying something something like "Ext is undefined." That's because the other scripts have statements like
			<code>Ext.define()</code>
		<p>
			Like any other programming environment, you run into problems if you reference symbols before they exist or are
			initialized. Script execution order can be tricky using
			<code>onReady()</code>
			.
		</p>

	</li>
	<li>Move the JavaScript into separate files
		<p>
			Rather than mixing HTML and JavaScript in the same file, it's better to separate the JavaScript into its own file,
			and reference it using a script tag's
			<code>src</code>
			attribute. It's also needed to take advantage of Ext JS's class loading (which we'll talk about later).
		</p>
		<p>To move the code, create four new files: <kbd>model.js</kbd>, <kbd>store.js</kbd>, <kbd>grid.js</kbd> and <kbd>app.js</kbd>. Copy and paste the
			contents of the corresponding script tags into each file, then add a <code>src</code> attribute to the tags. When you're
			finished, there will be no JavaScript in <kbd>index.html</kbd>. The index HTML file should end up looking like this:</p> <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/extjs4/resources/css/ext-all.css"&gt;

&lt;script src="/extjs4/ext-all-dev.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script src="model.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="store.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="grid.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="app.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>


		<p>Go to your browser, refresh the page and confirm that it still works.</p>

	</li>

	<li>This approach is limited
		<p>You now have an <kbd>index.html</kbd> file containing script tags that load your JavaScript files in a specific order:
			<kbd>ext-all.js</kbd> first, then the others. And those files may have dependencies of their own, further complicating the
			load order.</p>
		<p>This is how all Ext JS applications were coded before version 4.x. As applications get more and more complex,
			maintaining the <kbd>index.html</kbd> file, and its load order, can become difficult.</p>

		<p>
			<b>A key feature of Ext JS since version 4.x is its ability to dynamically load classes as they are referenced.</b>
			As a result, in Ext JS 4.x the <kbd>index.html</kbd> will typically contain two script tags: one to load the Ext JS library
			and one to load the starting point of your application. Each piece of code will specify what classes are required to
			run, and the Ext JS runtime environment will take care of loading things as needed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dynamic loading is built into
			<code>Ext.application()</code>
			and its <code>launch</code> callback function. The <code>launch</code> function is used just like the callback function passed to
			<code>Ext.onReady()</code>
			. In the next lecture we'll cover the syntax for
			<code>Ext.application()</code>
			and dynamic loading.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>If it's problematic, why is <code>Ext.onReady()</code> used?
		<p>Coding modular code is very good for any non-trivial application. But it's unnecessarily complicated when you
			just need to try something out.</p>
		<p>Think about the code at the start of this lab. If you simply need to see how to code a grid, it's a lot easier
			to have one file with all the JavaScript needed to create the grid and its store.</p>
		<p>
			When designing some aspect of your user interface, a common practice is to code a simple example in isolation in a
			single JavaScript file, with an
			<code>Ext.onReady().</code>
			When the code does what you want, you then break it into modules and integrate it into your application.
		</p>
		<p>
			Go to the Sencha's online documentation, and choose to the Examples tab. Almost every example is coded as a single
			JavaScript source file, with an
			<code>Ext.onReady()</code>
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>On the other hand...
		<p>
			<code>Ext.application()</code>
			is very easy to use, and has some additional features built-in, so you may choose to use
			<code>Ext.application()</code>
			for all your programming.
		</p>
	</li>

</ol>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this lab you contrasted using a single JavaScript source file, versus breaking up components into their own
	individual JavaScrpt files.</p>
<p>
	Using a single JavaScript file, with
	<code>Ext.onReady()</code>
	, is an easy way to try out a small piece of code without having to worry about the directory structure and syntax for
	doing dynamic loading.
