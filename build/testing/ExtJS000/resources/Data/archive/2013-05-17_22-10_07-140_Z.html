<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This is a Sencha Architect tutorial, where you'll create an application that reads
iTunes data, and shows music video thumbnails and video previews.
</p>
<p>
Take your time and read the instructions carefully. Save your work at the end of each step.
The tutorial should take about an hour to complete.
</p>


<h1>Required Software</h1>

<p>
To complete this tutorial you will need a copy of Sencha Architect (version 2.2 or newer), available from 
<a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/architect/" target="_blank">the Sencha web site.</a>
Install it, then read the "Explore the User Interface of Sencha Architect" section of 
<a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/architect/" target="_blank">the Sencha Architect product page</a>.
Familiarize yourself with the location of the parts of the Architect user interface:</p>
<ul class="plain">
<li>The Toolbox on the left, </li>
<li>the Canvas (and its Design view and Code view) in the middle, </li>
<li>the Project Inspector at the upper right and </li>
<li>the Config panel at the lower right.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You also need a locally-running web server, such as XAMPP, which can be downloaded 
<a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Following
the instructions on the XAMPP site, download XAMPP and start Apache. The application you're
about to create will be saved within the server's document root, which for XAMPP is in its installation directory,
under <kbd>xamppfiles/htdocs/</kbd>. You must have read/write permissions to all files and folders under the
document root.
</p>

<p>
Finally, you need to download a folder that contains a couple of resources needed by the application. 
Download 
<a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/25399147/TunesMini.zip" target="_blank">TunesMini.zip</a> and extract it under the document root for your web server. If you're 
using XAMPP, put it under the <kbd>htdocs</kbd> folder, mentioned in the previous paragraph.
</p>

<h1>The Application</h1>

<p>
<img align="left" src="resources/images/_tunes-mini/ShortYelpPreview.png" height="400px" style="margin: 8px 12px 0 0"/>
In this tutorial, you will use Sencha Architect to build an application that shows iTunes music
video thumbnails for the top 100 music videos and lets the user play the preview video in a popup window.</p>
</p>

<p>
All the information relating to the videos is dynamically fetched using the iTunes data feed, which
looks like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topmusicvideos/limit=10/json" target="_blank">this</a>. 
As you can see, the data is complicated. Buried within it is an array of items, each of which represents one music video. 
(The feed URL was created using the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/rss" target="_blank">the iTunes Store RSS Feed Generator</a>.)
</p>

<div  style="clear: both"/>
<br/>
<p>
The key pieces of the application are:
</p>
<ul class="plain">
<li style="margin: 8px 0 4px 0; line-height: normal">
An <code>Ext.data.Model</code> which is a record definition describing the fields we want from the feed.</li>
<li style="margin: 8px 0 4px 0; line-height: normal">
An <code>Ext.data.Store</code> which holds all the records created from the feed.</li>
<li style="margin: 8px 0 4px 0; line-height: normal">
An <code>Ext.container.Viewport</code> which is the base container for the application &mdash; it sizes the 
application to take up all available space in the browser window
</li>
<li style="margin: 8px 0 4px 0; line-height: normal">
An <code>Ext.panel.Panel</code> which is used for the panel titled "iTunes Music Video".</li>
<li style="margin: 8px 0 4px 0; line-height: normal">
An <code>Ext.view.View</code> which can render HTML content injected with values from a store. This is used for the 
list of video thumbnails.</li>
<li style="margin: 8px 0 4px 0; line-height: normal">
An <code>Ext.window.Window</code> which is used for the popup window containing the video preview.</li>
</ul>

<br/>


<ol>





<li>Initial setup &mdash; save path and project settings
<img src="resources/images/_tunes-mini/SavePath.png" align="right" width="40%" style="margin-top: 16px" />
<p>Open Sencha Architect.</p>
<p>On the initial welcome page, under Create New Project, select the latest version of Ext JS.</p>
<p>After Sencha Architect opens, click Save on the Architect main toolbar. This brings up a Save Project dialog.</p>
<p>Set the Save Path to:
<br/><kbd>[path to server root]/</kbd></p>
<p>Set the Project Name to <code>TunesMini</code>.</p>
<p>Click Save.</p>

<div style="clear: both"/>
<img src="resources/images/_tunes-mini/UrlPrefix.png" align="right" width="40%" style="margin-top: 8px" />
<p>Click Settings on the Architect main toolbar, and select the Project tab.</p>
<p>Set the URL prefix to:<br/><kbd>http://localhost/TunesMini</kbd></p>

<div style="clear: both"/>



</li>

<li>Set the application name
<p>In the Project Inspector, select the Application.</p>
<p>In the Config panel filter set the <code>name</code> property to <code>TunesMini</code>.</p>

<p>In general, when setting property values press Enter after entering the property name to ensure the name is
set. Another tip is that in the property list you can filter the list of config properties by typing in 
the filter text field. This makes it easier to find a property in the list. </p>
<img src="resources/images/_tunes-mini/SetApplicationName.png" width="50%" style="margin-top: 16px" />
<br/>
</li>





<li>Add a viewport
<p>In the Toolbox, select a Containers > Viewport and drag it to the Design View.</p>
<p>In the Design View, click the flyout gear to the right of the viewport and set <code>layout</code> to <code>fit</code>.
The "fit" layout results in the viewport's child panel taking up all the available space within the viewport.</p>
<img src="resources/images/_tunes-mini/AddViewport.png" width="60%" style="" />
<br/>
</li>





<li>Add the iTunes Music Videos panel

<p>In the Toolbox, select a Containers > Panel and drag it on top of the viewport in the Design View.</p>

<p>
In the Design View, double click the panel's "My Panel" title and replace it with the title "iTunes Music Videos". This set's the panel's
<code>title</code> property.
</p>
<p>In the Design View, click the flyout gear to the right of the panel and set <code>layout</code> to <code>fit</code>.
This panel also uses fit, because it will have one child &mdash; the thumbnails data view &mdash; which needs to take
up all the available space within the panel.</p>
</p>
<img src="resources/images/_tunes-mini/AddPanel.png" width="60%" style="" />
<br/>

</li>





<li>Save and preview the application
<p>On the Architect main toolbar, press Save and then press Preview. This opens a browser window with your running
application. There's not much there yet &mdash; you should see the "iTunes Music Videos" title bar. The rest of the 
window is empty. We'll add the thumbnails in the following steps.</p>
</li>


<li>Add a data view to show video thumbnails
<p>
In the Toolbox, select a Views > View and drag it on top of the panel in the Design View. It's at the bottom of the
list of components. (The "View" component is sometimes referred to as a "data view.")
</p>
<p>In the Design View, click the flyout gear to the right of the data view and set <code>autoScroll</code> to be checked.</p>
<p>In the Project Inspector, select the MyView data view, and in the Config panel set <code>itemId</code> to <code>tunesView</code>.
As a result, the Project Inspector will use "tunesView" for the name of the data view.</p>
<img src="resources/images/_tunes-mini/AddDataView.png" width="60%" style="" />
<br/>
</li>






<li>Describe the iTunes data using a model declaration
<p>In the Project Inspector, select the [+] button and choose Model.</p>
<p>In the Project Inspector, select the new model, and in the Config panel set <code>userClassName</code> to <code>Tune</code></p>
<p>In the Config panel go to the Fields property and press the (+) to its right. An input field
will appear. Type the fields in the data feed: <code>artist,id,image,link,preview,title</code> 
<br>then press Enter.</p>
<img src="resources/images/_tunes-mini/CreateModel.png" width="60%" style="" />
<br/>
</li>


<li>Specify where each data value is found within the feed
<p>The iTunes feed is complex, with each property buried within other properties. To handle this situation
Ext JS allows you to define a mapping for each field.</p>
<p>For each field, first select the field in the Project Inspector (under the Tune model declaration) and
in the Config panel set its <code>mapping</code> property to value specified here. Note that in the Config panel
filter you can type "mapping" and click the lock icon to the right. That will keep you on that property as you
select each field from the Project Inspector.</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Mapping</th></tr>
<tr><td>
<p style="margin-top: 0">
<code>artist</code><br/>
<code>id</code><br/> 
<code>image</code><br/> 
<code>link</code><br/> 
<code>preview</code><br/> 
<code>title</code>
</p>
</td>
<td>
<p style="margin-top: 0">
<code>['im:artist'].label</code>       <br/>
<code>id.attributes['im:id']</code>       <br/>
<code>['im:image'][2].label</code>    </br>
<code>link[0].attributes.href</code> <br/>
<code>link[1].attributes.href</code> <br/>
<code>['im:name'].label</code>
</p></td>
</tr>
</table>


</li>







<li>Create a store to hold the records</li>
<p>In the Project Inspector, choose the [+] button and choose Store > Json<b>P</b> Store.</p>
<p>In the Project Inspector, choose the MyJsonPStore store.</p>
<p>In the Config panel set <code>userClassName</code> to <code>Tunes</code></p>
<p>In the Config panel set <code>model</code> to <code>Tune</code></p>
<img src="resources/images/_tunes-mini/CreateModel.png" width="60%" style="" />
<br/>
</li>





<li>Specify the source URL in the store's proxy</li>

<p>In the Project Inspector, choose MyJsonPProxy under the Tunes store.</p>
<p>In the Config panel set <code>url</code> to<br/> <code>https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topmusicvideos/limit=100/json</code></p>

<p>In the Project Inspector choose MyJsonReader under the proxy.</p>
<p>In the Config panel set <code>root</code> to <code>feed.entry</code>. The root specifies the location
within the feed where the array of items is found.
</p>

<li>Have the store automatically load the data</li>
<p>In the Project Inspector, select the store.</p>
<p>In the Config panel set the <code>autoLoad</code> checkbox to checked. This specifies that at run-time the store will automatically load the iTunes data. 
In Architect it will also cause the store to load the data &mdash; you should see an
"eye" icon in the Project Inspector, next to the store. If you get an error, 
or don't see the eye, review the steps for coding the model and store.
</p>
<p>Click on the eye icon and you'll see the raw data. </p>
</li>






<li>Have the data view show the records</li>

<p>In the Project Inspector find the data view itemTpl property by looking under<br/>
Views > MyViewport > iTunes Music Videos > MyView > itemTpl
<br/>Double-click on <code>itemTpl</code>. This opens the Code view.
</p>
<p>
Copy and paste the following HTML snippet and replace the default <code>Data View Item {string}</code> that's there. 
Ext JS can render programmer-defined HTML content and dynamically replace "variables" within the HTML with data. These
are called <i>templates</i>.</p>
<pre>&lt;a href="{link}" target="itunes_store"&gt;
    &lt;img src="resources/images/iTunesBadge.gif"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="{image}" /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption>{title}&lt;br/>{artist}&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</pre>
<p>In the Canvas choose the Design button and select the data view. (This is the same
as selecting "tunesView" in the Project Inspector.) In the Canvas click on the flyout gear
by the data view.
Set <code>store</code> to <code>Tunes</code>. The data view
will use the template to show each record in the store. You should see iTunes thumbnails, rendered using the template.</p>
<img src="resources/images/_tunes-mini/DataViewShowsRecords.jpeg" style="" />
<br/>

</li>







<li>Save and preview the application
<p>
On the Architect main toolbar, press Save, then refresh your browser. You should 
see your thumbnails just like you did in Architect. Right now the thumbnails are shown 
in a single column. Since you set the data view to <code>autoScroll</code> you can scroll 
the list. In the next couple of steps we'll improve the layout of the data view.
</p>
</li>





<li>Add a CSS resource

<p>The video thumbnails in the view are shown as a single column. These would look better with a little styling.</p>
<p>In the Project Inspector, choose the [+] button and choose Resource > CSS Resource</p>
<p>In the Project Inspector, select the new CSS resource (under Application > Resources) &mdash; you may need to scroll
down to see it.</p>
<p>In the Config panel set <code>url</code> to <code>resources/style.css</code></p>
<p>Choose the Code View to see the new style sheet. It defines a <i>video</i> class
which is floating, with a specific height and width. This will be used for each video thumbnail. It
also defined a <i>overvideo</i> class, which will be used to highlight items.</p>
<img src="resources/images/_tunes-mini/ClsResource.png" width="60%" style="" />
<br/>
</li>





<li>Have the data view use the new CSS styles
<p>In the Project Inspector select the data view. We'll add a few properties via the 
Config panel Quick Value Set feature. Using Quick Set is equivalent to selecting the
property and setting its value. 
</p>
<p>
Note that there is an Add button to the right of the 
Filter or Quick Value Set field &mdash; that button is only used for adding a custom property, and is <i>never</i>
needed for TunesMini.
</p>
<p>
Copy and paste each of these property-value pairs
into the Quick Value Set field, and press Enter. 
<p>
<code>itemCls:'video'</code><br/>
<code>overItemCls:'overvideo'</code><br/>
<code>trackOver:true</code>
</p>
<p>After adding the first style you will see it in effect in the Design view.</p>
<img src="resources/images/_tunes-mini/DataViewWithCls.jpeg" style="" />
<br/>
</li>





<li>Save and preview the application
<p>
On the Architect main toolbar, press Save, then refresh your browser. You should 
see your thumbnails flowing from left to right in rows. Each item reflects the 
styling in the CSS, and each item is highlighted as you mouse over.</p>
<p>Now you need to create the preview window.</p>
</li>

<li>Create the preview window
<p>On the Toolbox select a Views > Window and drag it onto Views in the Project Inspector.</p>

<p>In the Project Inspector, select the new window, and in the Config panel use Quick Value Set to set:</p>
<p>
<code>userClassName:'PreviewWindow'</code><br/>
<code>height:352</code><br/>
<code>width:640</code><br/>
<code>modal:true</code><br/>
<code>resizable:false</code><br/>
</p>
<p>In the Config panel click the + by the <code>tpl</code> property to create an empty template, then
click the right arrow by the <code>tpl</code> property to open the new template in the Code view.</p>
<p>Copy and paste this template. The template contains a variable, which will be filled with 
the preview URL from the selected record when the window is shown.</p>
<pre>&lt;video autoplay preload="auto"&gt;&lt;source src="{preview}" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;</pre>

<img src="resources/images/_tunes-mini/WindowWithTpl.png" width="60%" style="" />
<br/>

</li>

<li>Create the controller
<p>Press the [+] at the top right of the Project Inspector and choose Controller.</p>
<p>In Project Inspector select the new controller and in the Config panel 
set <code>userClassName</code> to <code>TunesController</code>.</p>
</li>

<li>Add control logic

<p>
We need to detect when the user wants to view a video. To do this you need to create and show
the preview window when the user double-clicks on an item in the data view.
</p>

<p>In the Project Controller, select tunesView.</p>

<p>In the Config panel, find the <code>EventBindings</code> item, 
and click on the <code>(+)</code> to the right.</p>

<p>Select the <code>itemdblclick</code> event.</p>
<p>To move the event listener to the controller, 
right-click on <code>itemdblclick onTunesViewItemDblClick</code>,
select <code>Convert To Action > TunesController</code>.</p>

<p>In the Project Inspector, double-click on TunesController to see the code generated.</p>

<p>In the Project Inspector, double-click on <code>itemdblclick onTunesViewItemDblClick</code> method
now under the TunesController, and copy and paste in the following code:</p>

<pre>// Create an instance of the preview window 
// Have it update its template with the record the user selected 
// Show it

var w = Ext.create('TunesMini.view.PreviewWindow', {title: record.get('title')  + ', provided courtesy of iTunes'});
w.update(record.data);
w.show();</pre>

<p>
If you select the controller in the Project Inspector, then switch to Code View, you'll see the full
declaration of the controller, including the <code>init</code> and <code>onItemDblClick</code> functions.
</p>
</p>
</li>

<li>Look at your completed Tunes application!
<p>Press Save and refresh your browser. You should see your <b>completed</b>
application. It shows iTunes Music Videos thumbnails. If you double-click on 
an item you see the preview video! 
</p>
</li>

<li>Try out the Neptune theme
<p>Sencha comes with a few pre-defined themes.</p>
<p>
In the Project Inspector choose Resources > Library, and in the Config panel
set <code>theme</code> to <code>Neptune</code>. If you choose the viewport in 
the Project Inspector you'll see the theme in effect in the Canvas.
</p>
<p>
Press Save and refresh your browser. You should see your completed
application with the Neptune theme.
</p>
</li>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
Using Sencha Architect you've created an iTunes music video application in just a few minutes. 
</p>
<p>
The application dynamically fetches data from the Apple iTunes feed and populates a data store.
It uses a data view, with a template to show each record in the store. The user can click on the
iTunes icon for an item to visit the Apple store, or double-click on an item to see a preview
of the video in a popup window.
</p>
<p>
You could further enhance the application by adding a grid that shows other information from the 
feed, such as the price of each video.
