<p>We've tried to provide you with some helpful tips that can help to get you up to speed on sublimeText.</p>
<p><strong>Conventions used in these instructions.</strong></p> 
The first instruction is for the <strong>Mac</strong> platform, if there is a <strong>PC</strong> specific alternative, it will be in parentheses.</br>

<p class="small">
<b>Note: <em>The standards are for <strong>Cmd</strong> to be <strong>Ctrl</strong> on the PC and <strong>Option</strong> to be <strong>Alt</strong>. These will not be listed. <strong><em>Only exceptions will be shown</strong>. </em></p>
</i>
</p>



<h2>Setting up the Workspace</h2>
<p><strong>Cmd + B + K</strong> will hide the sidebar. May not need it if you get good at locating files with Cmd + P (e.g., can type ignore to find gitignore).</p>
<p><strong>Cmd + Ctrl + Shift + F</strong> will take you into distraction free mode - Nothing but editor for full screen. <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/distraction_free.html" target="_blank">Information on customizing Distraction Free Mode</a>.</p>
<p>Right-side sidebar is a screen shot of all code and lets you navigate quickly to any part of the file, just by clicking on the target code.</p>
<p><strong>Cmd + = </strong>Zooms in<br />
<strong>Cmd + -</strong> Zooms out</p>
<p>For Columns, <strong>Cmd + Option</strong>  + <strong>1, 2, 3</strong> or <strong>4</strong> for columns; <strong>Shift + Cmd + Option</strong>  + <strong>2</strong> or <strong>3</strong> for rows; or <strong>Shift + Cmd + Option</strong>  + <strong>5</strong> for a grid</p>
<p><strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>1, 2, 3</strong> or <strong>4</strong> allows you to move back and forth between the views. You also have the ability to go into the <strong>File Menu</strong> and choose <strong>New View Into File</strong>, then you can drag that into the same new interface so you can have two views of one file but the edits will show in both.</p>
<p><strong>Help Documentation</strong><br />
  A bit weak from Sublime but the Unofficial documentation from the community is quite good. Help area is also the area to get the info on submitting your own packages. The Sublime Forum is a very active community.<br />
  <br />
We hope this information will be useful to you.<em><strong> The Sencha Training Team</strong></em></p>
