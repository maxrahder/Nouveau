<h1>Custom theming</h1>
<p>
Before Ext JS 4.2, in Ext JS 4.1, when you wanted to style a Sass theme, you had to include all ext mixins,
so you could change it. If you hadn't implemented any mixins at all you would end up with an empty stylesheet.
</p>
<p>
In Ext JS 4.2, the theming procedure is changed. Since you are now extending from some other theme, you don't need to include all these mixins. If you want to change CSS rules, you have to overwrite it.
