There is another way.. of posting Ajax to an external server..
You'll need to setup the HTTP (Access-Control-Allow) headers on the server.
<br/><br/>
Itâ€™s called CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing), and it enables you to override the default restrictions that prevents a 
webserver from making AJAX request to other domains then from where the app is launched.
