<h3>Customization</h3>
<p><strong>Preferences</strong></p>
<p>There are two basic areas for preferences information. Default will show you what is available and User is where you should try to make changes that will persist.</p>
<p><strong>Cmd + ,</strong> gets you to these preference settings.</p>
<p><strong>Settings - Default </strong> shows all that you &quot;Can&quot; do but you want to change the <strong>User</strong> settings instead. You could also go into <strong>Settings More - Syntax Specific</strong> and then you can have your own settings for various types of file.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Themes<br />
</strong>I have added <em>Cobalt</em>, <em>Soda</em> and <em>Refresh</em>. There are many others available on the net. Sublime is also fully compatible with any <em>Textmate</em> themes you may find online.</p>
<p><strong>Key Bindings<br />
</strong>Just like with preferences, you can go into the <strong>Defaults</strong> and see what you want to use and then go to <strong>User</strong> to assign what you would like to override.</p>
<p>In general,  the shortcuts will be listed to the right in the drop down menus. Should you wish to add your own, you can go to Preferences - Keybindings - User and add them. </p>
<p>As an example if you wanted to create a shortcut for Line ReIndent and wanted to use the <strong>F12</strong> key you would type in the following:<br />
</p>
<pre>{&quot;keys&quot;: [&quot;f12&quot;], &quot;command&quot;: &quot;reindent&quot;}</pre>
