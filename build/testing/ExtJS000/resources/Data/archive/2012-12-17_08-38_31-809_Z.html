<p>Ext uses CSS mixins for every component. You can find all mixins in:<br/>
<strong><ext-folder>/resources/themes/stylesheets/ext4/default/_all.css</strong>
</p>

<p>
When using Sencha Cmd it includes all mixins by default.
You can disable this and add any mixins required for the project yourself:
</p>

<pre>
$include-default: false;

// Insert your custom variables here.
$base-color: #aa0000;

@import 'ext4/default/all';

// You may remove any of the following modules that you
// do not use in order to create a smaller css file.
