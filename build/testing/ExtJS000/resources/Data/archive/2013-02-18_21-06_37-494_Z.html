<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
You will build a single minimized JavaScript file containing all the components needed to run YelpExtplorer.
</p>

<ol>

<li>Build the application<p>
Use Sencha Cmd to build your application. To do this, simply use the terminal window to navigate to your Labs/YelpExplorer folder
and type:</p><pre>sencha app build</pre>
<p>
This launches a process that inspects your code to determine what components are used. 
</p>
</li>

<li>Manually move "data/categories.json"<p>
The category data would normally be supplied from the server. We placed the categories JSON fle in the "data/" folder for development-time 
convenience. The build process builds <i>client-side</i> code. Therefore, you need to manually copy and paste the "data" folder to
"SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/Labs/build/YelpExtplorer/production".</p></li>

<li>Inspect the generated folder<p>
The build process creates a new "SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/Labs/build/YelpExtplorer/production" folder. When running build
you have the option of specifying whether to make a production or testing build. Production is the default.</p>

<p>Inside the folder you will find "all-classes.js" and "index.html". The index file references "all-classes.js".</p>

<p>Note that the size of "all-classes.js" is about 1 megabyte. Compare that to the size of "ext-all.js" found in 
your original install of Ext JS &mdash; it's about 1.3 megabytes. The build process determined the components being used in YelpExtplorer, and only includes those in all-classes.js. Unused components aren't included, thus reducing the overall size of the library by about 25%.
</p></li>

<li>Compare versions

<p>Visit your "un-built, non-optimized" application at 
<img src="resources/images/_yelpExtplorer/NonBuildNetworkTraffic.png" align="right" height="50%"/>
<a href="http://localhost/SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/Labs/YelpExtplorer" target="lab">SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/Labs/YelpExtplorer</a> and
look at the number of source files loaded. There are a couple of hundred files being loaded as your <code>requires</code>,
<code>extend</code> and other dependencies are being evaluated. </p>
<div style="clear: both"/>
<p>Now visit your production application at 
<a href="http://localhost/SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/Labs/build/YelpExtplorer/production/" target="lab">SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/Labs/build/YelpExtplorer/production/</a> and
look at the number of source files loaded. There is now a <b>single</b> JavaScript file being loaded!</p>
</li>

<li>That's it!<p>That's all there is to the build process. It's easy to do, but it has a profound impact on your application. It reduces network traffic to a single JavaScript file and also reduces the overall size of the code being loaded.</p></li>
