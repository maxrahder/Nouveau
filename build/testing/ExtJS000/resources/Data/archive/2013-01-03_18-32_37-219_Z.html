As long as we're talking about dynamic loading, let's talk in more detail about the

<pre>
Ext.define('MyApp.view.Viewport', {
    extend : 'Ext.container.Viewport',    
    requires : [ 'MyApp.view.BeatlesGrid' ],
    layout : 'fit',
    items : [ {
        xtype : 'myapp_beatlesgrid',
        store : 'People'
    } ]
});</pre>
