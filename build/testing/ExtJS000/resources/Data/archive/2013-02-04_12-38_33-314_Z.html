<p>BDD is based on TDD</p>

<p>Behavior-driven development was developed by Dan North as a response to the issues encountered teaching test-driven development:</p>

<ul>
   <li> Where to start in the process</li>
   <li> What to test and what not to test</li>
   <li> How much to test in one go</li>
   <li> What to call the tests</li>
   <li> How to understand why a test fails</li>
</ul>
