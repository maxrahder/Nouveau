Aspect-oriented programming is trivial in Ext JS and JavaScript.

<pre class="runnable">
var lyrics = {
    all: '',
    add: function(words) {
        this.all += words;
    }
};

// Run it, then comment this in and run again.
//Ext.Function.interceptAfter(lyrics, "add", function(words){
//    this.all += ", yeah yeah yeah. ";
//});

lyrics.add("She loves you");

alert(lyrics.all);</pre>

<p> 
The programmer calling the <code>add</code> function has no way of
knowing it was intercepted. Introducing a bug in the intercepting function would
be very difficult to debug. <kbd>o_O</kbd>
