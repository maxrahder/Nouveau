<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Our usability expert has told us that Save buttons should look distinct from 
other buttons. In this lab you will theme the Save button in the <code>EditWindow</code>.
Furthermore, it seems like a good idea to include the viewport styling in the application's 
built CSS rather than having it in a separate file, so we'll move that into the application
styling too.
</br>

<h1>Objectives</h1>
<ul class="plain">
<li>Include CSS into an application theme</li>
<li>Style an application component class</li>
</ul>

<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>

<li>Create the Sass file to style your viewport
  <p>Create file <kbd>sass/src/view/View.scss</kbd>.</p>
</li>

<li>Move the style information into <kbd>sass/src/view/View.scss</kbd>
  <p>
    Open <kbd>stylesheet.css</kbd> and copy and paste its contents to <kbd>sass/src/view/View.scss</kbd> and save your changes.
</p>
<p>
Delete <kbd>stylesheet.css</kbd> and remove the corresponding reference from <kbd>index.html</kdb>.
<p>
Refresh your application to verify that the old stylesheet styling is no
longer in effect &mdash; the View tab should be unstyled.
</p>

<li>Build the application
<p>
In your terminal window, navigate to the <kbd>YelpExtplorer</kbd> directory and
use Sencha Cmd to build the application:
</p>
<pre>sencha app build testing</pre>
<p>Wait for the build to complete, then refresh the application. You should see
the style back in effect! </p>

<li>Review the mixin syntax for buttons
<p>
Open the API documentation and look at the mixin definition 
for <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.1/#!/api/Ext.button.Button-css_mixin-extjs-button-ui" target="api">Ext.button.Button</a>. 
</p>
<p>Mixin variables can be complicated, and it's not always obvious what's required. 
Sometimes it's easier to choose a mixin include from one of the theme packages as a starting
point. 
</li>

<li>Create the Sass file to style the Save button

<p>Yelp Extplorer only has a one save button, in the
  edit window. 
</p>
<p>
  To create a new button ui, we need to include the button mixin. But where should we put the code?
</p>
<p>Wherever we include the mixin, the ui style will be available throughout
  YelpExtplorer. We could put the code in <kbd>sass/src/view/detail/EditWindow.scss</kbd>.
  But putting the code in there implies that the code only only relates to the edit window. It may be more appropriate to put the code in a location that implies it's 
  used throughout the application. Two possibilities are <kbd>sass/src/view/Viewport.scss</kbd>, 
  or <kbd>sass/src/Application.scss</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
We'll use the latter, so create file <kbd>sass/src/Application.scss</kbd>.
</p>
</li>

<li>Include the button mixin
<p>Our usability expert says our Save buttons should be orange. The RGB for orange
is <code>#FF7F00</code>. We'll use that as the base color used in the button.</p>
<p>Use this <code>@include</code> in <kbd>Application.scss</kbd>:</p>
<pre>$base: #FF7F00;
@include extjs-button-ui(
    $ui: 'save-small',
    $background-color: lighten($base, 20%),
    $background-color-over: darken($base, 0%),
    $background-color-focus: darken($base, 0%),
    $background-color-pressed: darken($base, 0%),
    $background-color-disabled: lighten($base, 40%),
    $background-gradient: null,
    $border-radius: 4px,
    $border-color: darken($base, 50%),
    $glyph-color: #fff,
    $color: black,
    $font-family: $button-small-font-family,
    $font-weight: $button-small-font-weight,
    $padding: 4px
);
</pre>
<p>
The reason the ui name is "save-small" is that buttons automatically have
the "small" ui style applied to them to reflect the default button scale.
Buttons used in toolbars also have a "toolbar" style applied. By naming the
button "save-small", buttons with <code>ui:'save'</code> will use the style
only if the button is small, and not used in a toolbar.
</p>
<p>
(Note that the save and cancel buttons are coded in a <code>buttons:[]</code>
config. Under the covers, the buttons array is implemented as a bottom docked
toolbar, with special styling that excludes the "toolbar" style.)
</p>
</li>

<li>Rebuild the application
<p>In the terminal window use Sencha Cmd to build the application again.</p>
<p>When the application has been built, the new <code>ui</code> style will
be available to use for the Save button.
</li>

<li>Use the new ui
<p>
Edit <kdb>app/view/detail/EditWindow.js</kbd> and add <code>ui:'save'</code>
to the save button config.
</p>
<p>
Save your work and refresh the browser window. Open the edit window and you should 
see the new style in effect!
</p>
</li>
