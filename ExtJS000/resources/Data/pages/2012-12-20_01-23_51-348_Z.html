Sends the changes to just this model.
<ul>
<li>To use this, you must have a proxy declared on the Model
<li>All fields are always sent to the server even if only one field has changed
</ul>

We recommend that you declare a proxy on the Model instead of the Store, so that you have the option of using <code>Model.save()</code> to save one record at a time.
