<p><b>Question:</b> Gee, look at all that DOM! Do we need to understand how it's organized?</p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> No! We don't really care.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ext JS handles the details of what happens in the DOM</li>
<li>Even if you did figure it out, the details might change in some future release</li>
<li>So we don't really care <em>how</em> it happens, we just care about <em>what</em> it does!</li>
