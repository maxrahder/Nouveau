<b>Note:</b> JSONP requests can only use an HTTP GET.
</p>
<p>In other words, you <em>can</em>
send data, but it's sent in the query string rather than the request body. 
This limits the amount of data that can be sent, and the limit is browser-
specific.
</p>
<p>
Philosophically, the data sent in a GET is used to augment the request. 
POSTs are used to send data you expect to be be posted somewhere, such 
as data to update a database or data in a form.
