<p>In the last topic we saw that <kbd>sencha app build</kbd> creates a <kbd>.css</kbd> file. 
</p>
<p>The build process also builds a <kbd>.js</kbd> file containing everything needed to run your application. By default,
the file is minimized. Use the <kbd>testing</kbd> option to generate an un-minimized file.
</p>
<p>Only classes used by your application are included. For example, if your application doesn't have a tree panel, then no tree panel classes are included.</p>
