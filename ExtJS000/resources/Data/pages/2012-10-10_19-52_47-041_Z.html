Note that several layout managers ask you to tag child components with a "hint,"
so the layout manager knows how to arrange the component. For example, border layout
requires that each child be tagged with 
<code>north</code>,
<code>south</code>,
<code>east</code>,
<code>west</code> or 
<code>center</code>.

We'll explore the use of several of these layouts later in the course.
