<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>In this short lab, you'll dynamically add tabs to a tab panel.</p>

<ol>

<li>Review the solution
<p>
Run 
<a href="http://localhost/SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/LabSolutions/TabPanel/" target="lab">the solution</a>. The application contains a split button, and
an empty tab panel. As you choose from the split button, a new tab is added.
</p>
</li>

<li>Take a look at the code
<p>
Edit <kbd>Labs/TabPanel/app/view/Viewport.js</kbd>. Note how the toolbar 
is coded: when the user selects an item from the split button, the 
<code>addPerson()</code> method is run. 
</p>
</li>

<li>Finish the implementation of <code>addPerson()</code>
<p>
The <code>addPerson()</code> method has comments telling you what to do.</p>
<p>You may want to review 
<a href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/#!/api/Ext.panel.Panel-method-add" target="api">the API documentation for the <code>add()</code> method</a>. The <code>add()</code> method is straightforward. You can add an item config exactly like you would add it in the container's
<code>items</code> array. 
</p>
<p>
The add method returns a reference to the newly added component. To make it the 
current tab, run <code>setActiveTab()</code>, passing the new component.
</p>
</li>

</ol>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
You can easily add components to any container by passing the config object for the 
new component.

Tex Avery series of cartoons of the same name, Astro the dog in the Jetsons, Papa Smurf, Dr. Quest in Johnny Quest and others.</p>
