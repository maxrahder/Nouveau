<ul>
<li>Sencha MVC lets you separate your code into models, views and controllers
<ul>
<li><code>Ext.data.Store</code> definitions are placed in the "store" folder</li>
<li><code>Ext.data.Model</code> definitions are placed in the "model" folder</li>
<li><code>Ext.app.Controller</code> definitions are placed in the "controller" folder</li></ul></li>
<li>Encapsulate major components into their own classes</li>
<li>Think in terms of the API you want the calling routine to use</li>
<li>It's possible to fire custom events from the view, the controller can listen to these.</li>
</ul>
