<p>
To validate a record call its <code>validate()</code> method. That method returns an
<code>Ext.data.Errors</code> object, which is a collection of objects, one per validation
violation.
</p>
<p>
<code>Ext.data.Errors</code> has a <code>isValid()</code> method, and a <code>each()</code>
method which allows you to loop through each error. The error objects themselves have a 
"field" and "message" property.
