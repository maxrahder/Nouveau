To use a paging scroller you need to set <code>buffered:true</code> 
on the store.
</p>
<p>
Ext JS automatically uses a <code>bufferedrenderer</code> 
plugin with any grid associated with a buffered store.</p>

<p>
As the user drags the scrollbar selector, the grid loads its store, 
setting the "page" parameter to a value proportional to the position 
of the scroller.
</p>
<p>
The plugin fetches several pages for each <code>load()</code>. So 
scrolling up or down in the grid a little will <em>not</em> result 
in an additional page request. If you scroll past the buffered pages, 
the store requests a new set of pages.
