Some mixins are designed to be both used alone or as a mixin. 
<code>Ext.util.Observable</code> is one example.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you simply need an observable object, you can either create it directly</li>
<li>If you need additional functionality, you can extend it</li>
<li>If you are already extending another class, and need the functionality, then use it as a mixin</li>
</ul>
<p>
The last case is tricky, since <code>Ext.util.Observable</code> has a constructor.
We'll see an example in a few slides.</p>
