<p>Since your user interface is rendered by the 
browser, everything ultimately renders in the DOM. <code>renderTo</code>
can be used to specify a DOM element.

<p>
You may use <code>renderTo</code> when coding an example, and all Live Preview examples use it. But <b>in 
production code you probably won't see it at all!</b>
</p>
<p>
That's because most applications put <b>all</b> content within a single <code>Ext.Viewport</code>. 
A viewport is a container that automatically renders itself to the document body. We will talk viewport later.
