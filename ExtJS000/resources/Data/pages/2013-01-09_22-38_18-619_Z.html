<p>Most people can deal with success and dealing with failure will be a life long endurance trial, but we will try to help you address this as it relates to Post operations</p>

<p>In order for the form submit action to be considered a success, it must receive JSON data that resembles the following:</p>

<code>{success: true, msg: 'Thank you for submitting'}</code>	

<p>Alternatively, you can pass back JSON that indicates a series of errors took place. Ext will automatically invalidate the related form fields and display the corresponding error messages.</p>

<pre>
//server-side response
{
   success: false,
   errors: [
    {
       id: 'firstName',
       msg: 'This field must be corrected.'
    },{
       id: 'lastName',
       msg: 'Your name must comply with the instructions.'
    }
   ]
}
