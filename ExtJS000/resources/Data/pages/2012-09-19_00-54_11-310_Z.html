<ul>
	<li>Ext JS has its own set of low-level classes for selecting and manipulating DOM</li>
	<li>These classes allow you to change styling, do animations and other visual effects, all in a cross-browser way</li>
	<li>These classes are more powerful and easier to use than the native DOM classes</li>
	<li>Ultimately, these still end up running low-level DOM methods</li>
</ul>
