<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In this lab, you will start coding the YelpExtplorer application.
	This week we will build on the application until the complete application
	is coded, themed and deployed.
<ol>

	<li>Generate a workspace
		<p>Open a terminal window and change directories to your Ext JS
			directory.</p>
		<p>Generate a new workspace by typing</p> <pre>sencha generate workspace ../SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/Labs</pre>

		<p>Inspect the SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/Labs folder and note that
			Sencha Cmd has created a new folder named <b>ext</b>. This is a copy of
			the essential libraries and resources needed to develop and run Ext
			JS applications.</p>

		<p>Furthermore, all applications coded under the Labs
			folder will share the <b>ext</b> install.
	</li>

	<li>Generate the YelpExtplorer application

		<p>In the terminal window, navigate to
			<tt>SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/Labs/ext</tt> and generate the YelpExtplorer
			application by typing</p> <pre>sencha generate app YelpExtplorer ../YelpExtplorer</pre>
	</li>

	<li>Run the application
		<p>
			In your browser, open <a
				href="/SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/Labs/YelpExtplorer" target="lab">the
				initial application</a>.
		</p>
		<p>You should see a single tab titled "Center Tab 1" in the center
			and a panel titled "west" on the left. The application doesn't do
			anything yet.</p>
	</li>

	<li>Inspect the application
		<p>In your IDE look at the
			<tt>SenchaTraining/ExtJS251/Labs/YelpExtplorer/</tt> folder. You should see
			several files, organized according to Sencha's MVC file structure:</p> <img src="resources/images/_yelpExtplorer/initialFolder.png" />

	</li>

	<li>Inspect index.html
		<p>In your IDE open <tt>.../YelpExtplorer/index.html</tt>. Note that it
			references two JavaScript files: <tt>bootstrap.js</tt> and <tt>app.js</tt>.</p>
		<p>The bootstrap file contains classpath and alias mappings. Don't worry about the details of bootstrap.</p>
		<p><b>app.js</b> is the starting point of any Ext JS application.</p>
	</li>

	<li>Inspect app.js
		<p>
			In your IDE open <tt>.../YelpExtplorer/app/<b>app.js</b></tt>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>app.js</tt> is the starting point of an Ext JS application. It is an
			instance of
			<code>Ext.app.Application</code>
			. This code specifies the appliation's controllers, and creates the
			<code>viewport</code>, which is the top-level container for the the user
			interface.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>Inspect Main.js
		<p>
			In your IDE open <tt>.../YelpExtplorer/app/controller/<b>Main.js</b></tt>.
		</p>
		<p>
			This file contains the definition for a controller. Note that it
			extends
			<code>Ext.app.Controller</code>
			. Controllers coordinate events between data stores and components,
			but our controller doesn't do anything yet.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>Inspect Viewport.js
		<p>
			In your IDE open <tt>.../YelpExtplorer/app/<b>Viewport.js</b></tt>.
		</p>
		<p>This defines a viewport, using the <code>border</code> layout. It contains
			two components: a west panel and a center tab panel. The tab panel
			contains a single panel whose title is "Center Tab 1"</p>
	</li>

</ol>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this lab, you used Sencha Cmd to generate a new workspace. A
	workspace lets multiple applications share resources. You also
	generated an application, and reviewed the initial MVC file strucure.</p>
<p>As we write YelpExtplorer we will be refactoring this starting
	point, adding new views models, stores and controllers.</p>
