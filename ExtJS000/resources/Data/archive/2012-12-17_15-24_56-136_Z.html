<p>When using Sencha Cmd, it will automatically compress your generated CSS file.
Under the hood, this has been done by Compass which runs in Sencha Cmd based on the <code>output_style</code> setting in <b>config.rb</b>.

<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>:nested</td>
<td>
Nested style is the default Sass style, because it reflects the structure of the CSS styles and the HTML document they’re styling. Each property has its own line, but the indentation isn’t constant. Each rule is indented based on how deeply it’s nested.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>:expanded</td>
<td>
Expanded is a more typical human-made CSS style, with each property and rule taking up one line. Properties are indented within the rules, but the rules aren’t indented in any special way.<br/><br/>
Sencha Cmd will generate <kbd>mytheme-debug.css</kbd> with this <code>output_style</code>.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>:compact</td>
<td>
Compact style takes up less space than Nested or Expanded. It also draws the focus more to the selectors than to their properties. Each CSS rule takes up only one line, with every property defined on that line. Nested rules are placed next to each other with no newline, while separate groups of rules have newlines between them.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>:compressed</td>
<td>
Compressed style takes up the minimum amount of space possible, having no whitespace except that necessary to separate selectors and a newline at the end of the file. It also includes some other minor compressions, such as choosing the smallest representation for colors. It’s not meant to be human-readable.<br/><br/>
