<p>
Every component in the Ext JS framework has a ui configuration (which defaults to "default"). This property can be configured on individual Component instances to give them a different appearance from other Component instances of the same type.</p>

<p>For example, in the Neptune theme you can have a light or dark toolbar. There are also different appearances for buttons.</p>
