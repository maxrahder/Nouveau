<p>
So as a developer, you're sort of in two modes when writing code:
</p>

<div type="expander" caption="Low-level: Coding classes">
<p>
When defining classes you'll be in the role of the class designer, defining re-usable, decoupled components and classes. 
</p>
<p>
Your classes will typically subclass components, stores and record classes from the
Ext JS library.
</p>
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="High-level: The application">
<p>
You'll use your components within other components. Ultimately, those are
assembled into the full user interface for your application.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, you'll write the code that reacts to events, such as the user clicking on a
Save button. That code will have an application-wide perspective &mdash; updating records, sending data to the servet, etc.
</p>
</div>
