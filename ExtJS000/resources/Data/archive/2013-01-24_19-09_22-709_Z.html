<p>
To write an application you define your own components, stores, records (models)
and controller within specific folders. Each of these classes is defined in its 
own source file.

<p>
When referenced, the class definitions are automatically loaded.
</p>
<p>
A <dfn>controller</dfn> is also a class you define, whose purpose is to 
detect and coordinate user and system events and run business logic as a result.
