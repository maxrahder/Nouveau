<h2><strong>Package Control</strong> (and helpful packages)</h2>
<p>These allow you to customize the editor. We already had you add package control. <strong>View &gt; Show Console</strong> allows you to see under the hood. </p>
<p><strong>Recommended packages </strong></p>
<p>We suggested two packages to add functionality to sublime withh our setup instructions. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>JsFormat - </strong>a formatting aid<br />
Add <a href="https://github.com/jdc0589/JsFormat" target="_blank">https://github.com/jdc0589/JsFormat</a> to the URL Area.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>SublimeLinter - </strong>a tool that alerts you to possible JS errors<br />
  Add <a href="https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter" target="_blank">https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter</a> to the URL Area.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>There are many, many more available and we will address some of those below.</strong></p>
<p><strong>ReadMe Please</strong>. Allows you to quickly check out the Readme files of the packages you install.</p>
<p><strong>Color Picker</strong>. It allows you to use <strong>Cmd + Shift + C</strong> (<strong>Ctrl + Shift + C</strong>) to bring up a Color Picker in CSS and immediately assign the color value in your code. </p>
<p><strong>Line Endings</strong> helps you to avoid wrong line ending type with code built by various developers. </p>
<p><strong>Side Bar Enhancements</strong> allows you to get many additional enhancements to the editor. Worth checking out the Readme file to see what is possible. </p>
<p><strong>Hyperlink Helper</strong> allows you to use google or wikipedia to find appropriate link for the page. You can also set up to wrap text in a link. </p>
<p><strong>Emmet</strong> is another helpful package. It uses Emmet shortcut notation to quickly build html code. It builds a full shell. You can also use <strong>Ctrl + Opt + Right</strong> or <strong>Left Arrow</strong> to navigate insertion points in the HTML. <strong>Cmd + Shift + Period </strong>or<strong> Comma</strong>  allows you to navigate tag names, attributes and attribute values. <em>Toggle Comment</em> <strong>Cmd + Shift + /</strong> (<strong>Ctrl + Shift +</strong> <strong>/</strong>) allows you to comment front and ending tags. Another helpful feature will only be there if you add a value in the user Preferences. You will add <strong>&quot;auto_id_class&quot;: true</strong> and then you can go to html tag and by typing <strong>#</strong> you will get an id and by typing <strong>.</strong> you will get a class addition. More at <em>docs.emmet.io.</em> (Shortcuts may be different on sublime, so check the Readme.) If you go to the </p>
<p><em><strong>Sublime Package Control</strong></em> website, you can find additional packages by looking in the <em>Community Sublime Packages</em>. (Might want to look at these. <strong>SFTP</strong> if you use ftp.<br />
  <strong>PlainTasks</strong> allows you to create a list of to do tasks to manage to do projects.</p>
