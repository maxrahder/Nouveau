<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In this lab, you will code the dataview, and sync its row
    selection to the rest of the user interface.</p>

<ol>

    <li>Plan what you will be doing
        <p>Under the "View" tab you need a dataview, wired up to the
            Businesses store. You will be adding a few properties that
            specify CSS classes to use as the user mouses over or
            selects items.</p>
        <p>Then you will update the Business controller to detect a
            select on the view. The event handler will sync the user
            interface with the selected record.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Modify <tt>view/View.js to show businesses</tt>
    
        <p>Have the yepview extend <code>Ext.view.View</code> and add a few
            properties:</p> <pre>autoScroll : true,
emptyText : 'There are no matching businesses.',
padding : 8,
tpl : '&lt;div class="businesses"&gt;&lt;tpl for="."&gt;&lt;div class="business"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="{photo_url}" /&gt;&lt;figcaption>{name}&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/tpl>&lt;/div&gt;',
itemSelector : 'div.business',
overItemCls : 'over',
selectedItemCls : 'selected'</pre>

        <p>Notice that the itemSelector matches the div within the
            template for-loop.</p>
            
        <p>Since we have just created our content, remove the <code>html</code>
            property.</p>

    </li>

    <li>Add a style sheet
        <p>
            The dataview specifies <code>overItemCls</code> and <code>selectedItemCls</code>.
            These are applied as the user mouses over an item, or
            selects an item. Therefore, we need styles for these CSS
            class names. Create a new file, <b>stylesheet.css</b> and
            place it at the root of the YelpExtplorer folder (at the
            same level as the "index.html". Here is the content of the
            CSS file:
        </p> <pre>.businesses figure {
	margin: 0
}
.businesses figcaption {
	text-align: center;
	font-size: 7pt
}
.businesses .business {
	height: 134px;
	width: 108px;
	margin: 4px;
	float: left;
	border: 4px solid #aaaaaa
}
.businesses .business img {
	height: 100px;
	width: 100px
}
.businesses .over {
	border: 4px solid #555555
}
.businesses .selected {
	border: 4px solid black
}</pre>
        <p>Save the CSS file, then open <tt>index.html</tt> and add a link
            to the new style sheet. Later, when we theme the
            application, we will move the styles to a SASS file, and
            generate a comprehensive CSS that includes both our styles
            and Ext JS styles.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Associate the store with the view
        <p>
            Edit <tt>view/View.js</tt> and add
            <code>store:'Businesses'</code>
            to the dataview config.
        </p>
        
        <p>Save and refresh and you should see the dataview
            populated with the same records shown on the map. Yay!
    </li>

    <li>Keep record selections in sync
        <p>
            Edit
            <tt>controller/Business.js</tt>
            and listen to the select method on the dataview. This will
            be virtually identical to the code that listens to the map.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Add two new items to the <code>refs</code> array: one for the dataview, and one for the map.
            Name them "dataView" and "map". This will allow us to access
            these components in our controller methods with
            <code>this.getDataView()</code>
            and
            <code>this.getMap()</code>
            .
        </p>
        <p>
            In the
            <code>onBusinessSelect</code>
            method, add two new lines to select the record on the
            dataview and in the map. The idea is that when someone
            clicks on either the map or the dataview item, all parts of
            the user interface will reflect the selection. The two new
            lines look like this:
        </p> <pre>this.getDataView().getSelectionModel().select(record);
this.getMap().highlight(record);</pre>
    </li>
    
    <li>Wait! There's something wrong!<p>You may have noticed that if you select a school, 
    then select the dataview, then select a map item. Then things are in sync properly.
    You can then select another item on the map, and the dataview stays in sync.</p>

    <p>But if you initially select an item on the map, then go to the dataview, you don't
    see the item selected. This only happens the first time! What's going on?</p>
    
    <p>Recall from lecture that components don't render until they need to. In this case,
    the dataview doesn't render the template until the user clicks on the View tab. But the way
    items are shown to be selected in a dataview is via a class being added to a DOM element
    defined in the dataview's template. Before the dataview is rendered there <i>is no</i> DOM 
    element. If you were to inspect the DOM you'd see this in action: the dataview elements don't 
    exist in the DOM until you click on the View tab.</p>
    <p>
    To fix this, open <tt>view/Main.js</tt> and add one more property to the tab panel: <code>deferredRender:false</code></p>
    <p>Save your change, and refresh the browser. Immediately select a map item, then go to the View tab. The item 
    should be selected!</p></li>
