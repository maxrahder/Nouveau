<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
This lab will help you discover how we will do some of the labs that use the 
Live Preview feature. Obviously, we haven't covered any concepts or
syntax yet, so don't worry about the details for now. 
</p>
<p>
Live Preview labs are intended to be small, stand-alone labs that let you try out syntax or a few features.
</p>
<p>
<b>Important: </b> For any Live Preview lab, just like Live Preview examples in the API documentation, 
<b>if you leave the page you lose your work!</b> You can open new windows or tabs, but <b>be careful not to leave 
the lab instructions page until you've finished.</b> 
</p>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<ol>

	<li>See the code at the top?
	<p>Some labs launch with a panel at the top of the page containing a code snippet. When that happens, 
	lab steps will have you preview, modify and run the code. Other labs have you use a text editor or your
	IDE to modify code. </p>

	<li>Try it out
		<p>Click "Live Preview" button and the code is run. Clicking back on "Code Editor" goes back to showing you the code.</p>
  </li>

	<li>Examine the code
		<p>
		The code runs a function, <code>Ext.create()</code>, passing two arguments. </p>
		<p>The first argument is the name of the class being created &mdash; either a class in the Ext JS library, or a 
		class you've defined. In this case, it's the name of the button component.</p>
		<p>The second argument is a JSON object, describing the thing being created. The button is
being created with two properties: <code>text</code> and <code>renderTo</code>, described below.
	</li>

  <li>What is <code>renderTo</code>?
<p>Right now, we don't really care. <code>;-)</code></p>
<p>
The <code>renderTo</code> property specifies where in the DOM the component creates itself. You'll rarely use <code>renderTo</code>, unless you are coding a little example or test, like we are here.</p>
<p>We will discuss <code>renderTo</code> in more detail later in the class.</p>
</li>

	<li>Change the button's text
		<p>
		Click on <em>Code Editor</em> and change the <code>text</code> property to some other string. Then press <b>Live Preview</b>. 
		You should see your changes. The API documentation, lecture slides and labs have numerous Live Preview
		examples.</p><p>Seeing examples and trying things out is one of the best ways to learn Ext JS. 
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>Add a <code>click</code> event handler
		<p>
		As long as we're trying things we haven't covered in lecture, let's try to add some code to be run when you click on the button.
		</p>
		<p>For buttons, the <code>handler</code> option specifies a callback function to be run when the user clicks on it. </p>
		<p>Here's an example.</p>
		<pre class="sample">
handler: function(button){
	alert('You clicked the ' + button.getText() + ' button!');
}</pre>
		<p>Add a handler, like the one above, and try it out. If you have trouble getting it to work, ask your instructor
		to help.</p>
	</li>

	<li>Give the button sub-items
		<p>
		Buttons have a lot of properties. For example, they can be made "toggleable," they can have an icon and they
		can have a set of sub-items. Let's add sub-items under the button. 
		</p>
		<p>To do that, buttons have a <code>menu</code> config property that can take an array of button configs. Here's
		an example:</p>
		<pre class="sample">menu : [{text: 'Option One'},{text: 'Option Two'}]</pre>
		<p>Add that config property to your code.</p>
		<p>Notice that these sub-items are just JSON objects with a <code>text</code> property. In the case of
		buttons, it is assumed that the <code>menu</code> array items are button configs.</p>
	        <b>Try it out</b>
		<p>
		Press <b>Live Preview</b> and see how it looks. Note that as you click on your button, your event handler is still 
		run, and the dropdown of sub-items is shown.</p>
	</li>


	<li>Use a <em>split button</em> instead

		<p>
		Rather than have the handler run when all you want to do is show the sub-items, there's another type of button
		called a <em>split button</em>.</p><p><code>Ext.button.Split</code> subclasses <code>Ext.button.Button</code>. It's just a specialized kind of button.
		</p><p>To use
		a split button, change the first parameter being passed to <code>Ext.create()</code> to reference the split button class
		instead. Run it. Now, the drop down icon only shows the sub-items. Clicking elsewhere on the parent button
		runs its handler.</p>
	</li>
<h1>Optional</h1>
	<li>Add more handlers, and more sub-items
		<p>
		Since each sub-item in the <code>menu</code> array is the config of a button, you can add a <code>handler</code> and <code>menu</code>
		arrays to those too. Add a few buttons under one of the sub-items. Put a handler on one of those.</p>
		<p><b><i>A word of caution</i></b> As JSON objects get more complex it's easy to forget a comma, or get confused about the 
		bounds of a nested object or array. So it's best to make very small changes, then run the code to make sure everything
		still works. Then add another small change, and test that. And so on.</p>
	</li>

</ol> 
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The purpose of the lab was for you to discover the benefits of <em>Live Preview</em> and get a feel for how we will be doing many of our labs.
You also saw how to create buttons, add a handler, add sub-items and use a split button.</p>
