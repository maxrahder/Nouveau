<li>Illuminations for Developers was created by Steven Roussey, one of the volunteer developers of Firebug.  Illuminations currently only works in FireFox.
<li>It is VERY useful for inspecting Ext JS components and other Ext JS objects.

<li>In this example, we are able to look at the components inside a YelpExtplorer.view.Viewport,
and at the properties of the YelpExtplorer.store.OnlineCategories store (highlighted)
